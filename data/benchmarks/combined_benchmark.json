    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to increased shortness of breath. His mother is particularly disturbed because her son wakes up breathless one or 2 nights every week. He was diagnosed with asthma 2 years ago. Over the past few months, he has not been able to participate in any sport and is also using his inhaler more than 3 times a week. On examination, the patient appears to be in slight distress and seems pale and fatigued. There are slight expiratory wheezes and crackles in both lungs. The pediatrician starts him on a low dose of another inhaler which needs to be taken once daily. She asks his mother to avoid any conditions that might aggravate her son\u2019s symptoms and make it difficult for him to breathe. Three months later, the mother is back with her son at the same pediatrician\u2019s office. She is concerned about a painless white plaque on his tongue. When the physician scrapes the lesion it reveals a red base with minimal bleeding. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following was most likely prescribed during the previous visit?",

    "answer": "Having a regular primary care clinician is embraced in pediatrics, although team care among physicians is also widely practiced. For young children, having a regular clinician is associated with modest gains in interpersonal quality and no differences in content of anticipatory guidance. The benefit of having a regular clinician may primarily occur in interpersonal quality for subgroups of young children.",
