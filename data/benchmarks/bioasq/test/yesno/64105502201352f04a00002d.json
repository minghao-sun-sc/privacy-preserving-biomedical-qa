Assessments included timed rise from floor, timed 10\u202fm walk/run, six-minute walk distance, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Mean age at baseline was 5.9 years (range 4.1-8.1 years). Test-retest reliability was high for functional assessments, regardless of time lag between assessments (up to 90 days) and for the majority of age groups. Correlations were strong among the functional measures and timed tests, less so with FVC.",
