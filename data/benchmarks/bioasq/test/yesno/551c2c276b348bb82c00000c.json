  "question": "Does ghrelin play a role in ischemic stroke?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. It has been shown that serum ghrelin levels are reduced after ischemic stroke and ghrelin is associated with stroke type. Ghrelin can be a useful marker for the prediction of stoke after cardiopulmonary bypass. Ghrelin may be neuroprotective after injury in animal models of cerebral ischemia by inhibiting apoptotic processes,  inflammation, nNOS activity and modulating gastrointestinal motility.",
