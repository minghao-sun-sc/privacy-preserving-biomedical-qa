  "question": "Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that valproic acid (VPA) is associated with prolonged survival of glioblastoma patients. Several studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons.",
