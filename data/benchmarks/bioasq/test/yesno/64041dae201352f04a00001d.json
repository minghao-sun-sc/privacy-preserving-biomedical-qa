      "text": "POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 involved 1688 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. After 16\u00a0weeks, in both studies, over 50% of patients treated with deucravacitinib reached PASI75, which was significantly superior to placebo and apremilast. In POETYK PSO-1, these results improved until week 24 and were maintained through week 52, with over 65% of patients achieving PASI75 at this point. A reduction in signs and symptoms was also reported by patients, with greater impact on itch. Deucravacitinib was well tolerated and safe. ",
