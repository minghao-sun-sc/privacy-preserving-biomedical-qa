  "question": "Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?",
  "ideal_answer": "The GAGA factor is a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions. While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.",
