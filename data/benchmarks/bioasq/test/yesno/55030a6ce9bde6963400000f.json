  "question": "Is Titin the largest single protein molecule found in Nature?",
  "ideal_answer": "Titin, is definitely the largest protein in the body, with a molecular weight of 3 million Dalton and composed of 27,000 amino acids. Titin is the largest protein known to date and acts as a mechanosensor that regulates muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion.",
