  "question": "Is there a role for TFII-I in megakaryopoiesis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. TFII-I acts as a repressor of \u03b2-globin gene transcription and is implicated in the differentiation of erythrocytes into megakaryopoiesis.  Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of TF II-I and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, TFII, in erythroid cells. TF2-I has a role in embryonic development and differentiation of all eukaryotes but its physiological function is still unclear.",

      "text": "TFII-I is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates gene expression. TFII-I has been implicated in neuronal and immunologic diseases as well as in thymic epithelial cancer. Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I. A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes. We conditionally deleted the TFII-I/Gtf2i gene in adult mice by tamoxifen induced Cre-recombination. Bone marrow cells revealed defects in erythro-megakaryopoiesis and an increase in expression of the adult \u03b2-globin gene. The data show that TFII-I acts as a repressor of \u03b2-globin gene transcription and that it is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells.",
