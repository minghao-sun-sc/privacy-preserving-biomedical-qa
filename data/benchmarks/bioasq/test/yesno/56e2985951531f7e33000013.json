  "question": "Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?",
  "ideal_answer": "R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins. Physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. One mechanism may be that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed. Thus, the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery.",
