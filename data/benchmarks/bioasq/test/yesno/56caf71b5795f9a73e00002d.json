  "question": "Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?",
  "ideal_answer": "mTORC1 was found to regulate STAT3 activity in, at least, three ways: 1) after induction by IL6, 2) by direct phosphorylation during hypoxia, to promote HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA transcription, and 3) after activation by excess amino acids, which then positively regulate Notch1 expression through STAT3 activation.",
