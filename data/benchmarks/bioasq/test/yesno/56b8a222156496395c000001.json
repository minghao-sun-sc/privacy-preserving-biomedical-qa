  "question": "Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the \"re-wiring\" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.",
