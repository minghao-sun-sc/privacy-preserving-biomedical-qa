  "question": "Does the majority of the mitochondrial genomes abide to the second parity rule (PR2)?",
  "ideal_answer": "A large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule, in contrast to the eubacterial ones. This behaviour of the large majority of the mitochondrial genomes may be attributed to their distinct mode of replication, which is fundamentally different from the one of the eubacteria.",
