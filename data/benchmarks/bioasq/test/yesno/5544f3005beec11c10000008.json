  "question": "Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?",
  "ideal_answer": "Spontaneous point mutation rate in a gene increases with its transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es). This phenomenon is termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). Transcription-associated mutagenesis is directly proportional to the level of gene expression.",
