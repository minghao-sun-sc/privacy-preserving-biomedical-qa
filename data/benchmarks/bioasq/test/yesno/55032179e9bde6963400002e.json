  "question": "Are BBS mutations involved in syndromic Hirschsprung disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "In 3 families with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), concomitant mutations in BBS genes and regulatory RET elements have been identified. Analysis of the data suggests that BBS mutations can potentiate HSCR predisposing RET alleles, which by themselves are insufficient to cause disease.",
