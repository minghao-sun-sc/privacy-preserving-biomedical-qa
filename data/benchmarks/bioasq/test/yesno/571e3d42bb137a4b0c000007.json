  "question": "Is SLC22A3 expressed in the brain?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, SLC22A3 (organic cation transporter (OCT3)) is widely expressed in various organs in humans, and involved in the disposition of many exogenous and endogenous compounds. Several lines of evidence have suggested that OCT3 expressed in the brain plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmission.",
