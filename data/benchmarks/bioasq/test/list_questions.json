These features may represent high-throughput data mapped to reference genome or sets of genomic annotations in that reference genome. StereoGene enables correlation of continuous data directly, avoiding the data binarization and subsequent data loss. Correlations are computed among neighboring genomic positions using kernel correlation.

StereoGene also accounts for confounders such as input DNA by partial correlation. We apply our method to numerous comparisons of ChIP-Seq datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE to demonstrate its wide applicability. We observe the changes in the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types consistent with known biology and find a novel spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with donor splice sites and with poly(A) sites.

    "ideal_answer": "Several factors have been associated with severe COVID-19. Age is a significant risk factor, with older adults being more likely to experience severe symptoms and require hospitalization. Individuals with underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are also at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Additionally, male sex has been identified as a risk factor for severe disease. Other factors that may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 include smoking history and immunocompromised status. It is important to note that while these factors have been associated with increased risk of severe disease, anyone can develop severe COVID-19 regardless of age or underlying health conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to continue practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing to reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations.",

METHODS: Body composition (body mass index and bioimpedance analysis) and laboratory data were obtained from 110 dialysis patients. The MS was identified according to ATP-III criteria. Anemia parameters, hemoglobin (Hgb), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone levels, and rHuEPO requirements over the last 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with the MS seem to reach target Hgb levels more frequently (10-12 g/dL; 66.3% vs 84.8%; P = .03) without any difference in total intravenous iron therapy dosage. MS patients also required lower rHuEPO for reaching similar Hgb levels compared with patients without MS (2679.3 \u00b1 1936.1 vs 3702.5 \u00b1 2213.0 U/kg/6 mo; P = .02). There we",

However, current MetS criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to delineate differential contributions to MetS by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate MetS severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a CFA of a single MetS factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score. RESULTS: Loadings to the single MetS factor differed by sub-group for each MetS component (p<0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. MetS severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of MetS but high MetS severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional MetS components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of MetS for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for MetS-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time.

These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: signeR is implemented in R and C\u2009++, and is available as a R package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/signeR",

        "text": "Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition.Results: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.Availability: All tools developed in this paper have been implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation.",

        "text": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \"mutation signatures\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \"mixed-membership models\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.

    "ideal_answer": "DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases catalyze the specific transfer of a methyl group  to the C5 position of cytosine residues in DNA. Three families of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases have been identified in mammals: DNMT1, DNMT2 and DNMT3 (including DNMT3a, DNMT3b and DNMT3L isoforms). All of them share homologous catalytic domains. DNMT1 is the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdmaintenance\u201d methyltransferase family. DNMT1 is specific for hemi-methylated DNA and ensures the faithful transmission of DNA methylation patterns in every replication cycle. DNMT3 is required for de novo methylation of DNA. DNMT3 targets unmethylated DNA and is responsible for the establishment of new methylation patterns. Dnmt2, in contrast to all other mammalian DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, does not possess a large N-terminal regulatory domain. The DNA methylation activity of DNMT2 is still controversial.",
