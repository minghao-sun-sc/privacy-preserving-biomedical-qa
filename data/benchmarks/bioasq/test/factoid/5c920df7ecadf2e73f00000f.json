      "text": "Apixaban (Eliquis\u00ae) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Like other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban has generally predictable pharmacological properties and does not require routine anticoagulation monitoring. In large phase III trials, oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapped with and followed by oral warfarin (enoxaparin/warfarin) in the treatment of adults with acute VTE over 6\u00a0months with regard to the incidence of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death (AMPLIFY), and was significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention of recurrent VTE or all-cause mortality over 12\u00a0months in patients who had completed 6-12\u00a0months' anticoagulation treatment for VTE (AMPLIFY-EXT).
