  "question": "The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene is responsible for mediating the X-chromosome inactivation in females, where one X-chromosome is silenced and transcriptionally inactivated. What does Xist encode?",
  "ideal_answer": "Xist is a gene that encodes a long noncoding RNA molecule, which plays a central role in inducing X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals. The Xist RNA has two major splicing variants: long and short isoforms. It is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and required for the silencing of most genes on that chromosome. The specific localization of Xist transcripts to the inactive X is important for silencing, but it is not known how these transcripts localize to the inactive X chromosome. Silencing on the inactive X chromosome coincides with the acquisition of chromatin modifications, resulting in the formation of extraordinarily stable facultative heterochromatin that is faithfully propagated through subsequent cell divisions. The integration of all these processes requires a region of the X chromosome known as the X-inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene and its cis-regulatory elements.",
