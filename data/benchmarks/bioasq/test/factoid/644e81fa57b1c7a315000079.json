  "question": "What are negative cell-cycle regulators that can cause cancer when mutated called?",
  "ideal_answer": "Negative cell-cycle regulators that can cause cancer when mutated are commonly referred to as tumor suppressor genes. These genes play a crucial role in controlling cell division and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which could lead to the formation of tumors. Tumor suppressor genes function by inhibiting cell cycle progression, promoting DNA repair, and inducing apoptosis in response to cellular stress or damage. Some well-known examples of tumor suppressor genes include TP53 (p53), RB1 (retinoblastoma protein), and CDKN2A (p16INK4a). Mutations or loss of function in these genes can disrupt their ability to regulate the cell cycle, thereby contributing to the development of cancer. In many cases, both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for a complete loss of function, following Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. The identification and study of tumor suppressor genes have significantly advanced our understanding of cancer biology and provided potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",

      "text": "The cell cycle (or cell-division cycle) is a series of events that take place in a cell, leading to its division and duplication. Cell division requires cell cycle checkpoints (CPs) that are used by the cell to both monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle. Tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) or antioncogenes are genes that protect the cell from a single event or multiple events leading to cancer. When these genes mutate, the cell can progress to a cancerous state.",
