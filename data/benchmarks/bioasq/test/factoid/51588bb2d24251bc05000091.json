  "question": "Which antiepileptic drug is most strongly associated with spina bifida? ",
  "ideal_answer": "Phenytoin is not used in pregnancy as it is associated with a severe fetal deformation. From the other anticonvulsants most studies report the higher association between use during pregnancy and spin bifida to occur with Valproate.",

A nested case-control study was performed, comparing drugs used in early pregnancy in the 9 cases and in 18 controls, matched for year of delivery, maternal age, and parity. Six of the spina bifida mothers had used carbamazepine and two had used valproic acid. Among the controls, 5 women used carbamazepine and one valproic acid. There is an apparent excess risk for spina bifida after use of either of these two drugs, but it is not statistically significant when the analysis is restricted to drug-using women. T",
