  "question": "When is the drug Ivermectin used?",
  "ideal_answer": "Ivermectin (IVM) has been well known for its role in the treatment of parasitic diseases, due to its effect on glutamate-gated chloride channels. These same channels are also present in the mosquito vector, and thus, research has focused on the insecticidal effects of this drug.",

Heifers raised in a semi-intensive grazing system in southern Brazil were used. Levamisole and ivermectin were selected as the high- and the low-efficacy drugs, respectively, based on a previous efficacy test.",
