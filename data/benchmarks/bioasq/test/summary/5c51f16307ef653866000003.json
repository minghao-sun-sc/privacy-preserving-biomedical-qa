  "question": "Describe SLIC-CAGE",
  "ideal_answer": "SLIC-CAGE is a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. SLIC-CAGE can generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods.",
