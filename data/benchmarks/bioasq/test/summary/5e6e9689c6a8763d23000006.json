  "question": "What are Syndecans?",
  "ideal_answer": "Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans with heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains attached to their extracellular domain. Like many proteoglycans, they interact with a large number of ligands, such as growth factors, adhesion receptors, soluble small molecules, proteinases, and other extracellular matrix proteins to initiate downstream signaling pathways. Syndecans play a major role in inflammation, mainly by regulating leukocyte extravasation and cytokine function.",
