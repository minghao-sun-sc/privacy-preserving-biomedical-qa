  "question": "What is the benserazide's mechanism of function when co-administered with L-DOPA in patients with Parkinson's Disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. Benserazide in combination with L-DOPA constitutes a slow-release formulation of L-DOPA in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), it reduces peaks and rapid fluctuations of L-DOPA plasma levels (possibly responsible for peak-dose dyskinesias and end-of-dose deterioration) and considered as the best available therapy.",

      "text": "Recent human and animal biochemical investigations clearly confirm and extend previous findings indicating that benserazide is much more potent than carbidopa as peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or carbidopa constitutes the best available therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). To reduce peaks and rapid fluctuations of L-DOPA plasma levels (possibly responsible for peak-dose dyskinesias and end-of-dose deterioration) a slow-release formulation of L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or with benserazide plus catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors should be developed.
