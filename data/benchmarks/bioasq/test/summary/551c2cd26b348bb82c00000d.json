  "question": "Does helicobacter pylori infection increase risk for ischemic stroke?",
  "ideal_answer": "Findings regarding association between helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke risk are conflicting. There is evidence to suggest that helicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke and should be considered stroke risk factors. However, some studies reported no association between helicobacter pylori infection and stroke.",
