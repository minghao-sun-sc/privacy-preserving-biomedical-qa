  "question": "What is the role of Tcf3 in the maintenance of pluripotency?",
  "ideal_answer": "The maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells relies on a transcriptional network that is fuelled by the activity of three transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) and balanced by the repressive activity of Tcf3 . We uncover a key role for post-translational regulation in the maintenance of pliospotency .",
