  "question": "What is the role of deadenylases in the cell?",
  "ideal_answer": "The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as \"deadenylation\" which is carried out by deadenylases. Deadenylases are magnesium dependent exoribonucleases that specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'-->5' direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product. They consist of three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain.",
