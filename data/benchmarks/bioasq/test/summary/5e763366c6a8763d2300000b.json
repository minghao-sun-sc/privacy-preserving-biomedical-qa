  "question": "What is ORMD-0801?",
  "ideal_answer": "ORMD-0801 is an oral insulin capsule. Treatment with ORMD-0801 was associated with a significant 24.4% reduction in the frequencies of glucose readings >200 mg/dL (60.1 +- 7.9% pretreatment vs. 45.4 +- 4.9% during ORMD-0801 treatment; p = 0.023) and a significant mean 16.6% decrease in glucose area under the curve (AUC) (66055 +- 5547 mg/dL/24 hours vs. 55060 +- 3068 mg/dL/24 hours, p = 0.023), with a greater decrease during the early evening hours. When used in conjunction with subcutaneous insulin injections, ORMD-0801 was well tolerated and effectively reduced glycemia throughout the day.",
