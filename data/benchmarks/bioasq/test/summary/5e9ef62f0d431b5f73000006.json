  "question": "What are the uber-operons?",
  "ideal_answer": "Uber-operons are groups of functionally or transcriptionally related operons, whose gene sets are conserved across multiple reference genomes. Many of the uber-operons correspond to parts of known regulons or biological pathways or are involved in highly related biological processes based on their Gene Ontology (GO) assignments.",
