      "text": "In contrast to the traditional mechanism of drug action that relies on the reversible, noncovalent interaction of a ligand with its biological target, a targeted covalent inhibitor (TCI) is designed such that the initial, reversible association is followed by the formation of a covalent bond between an electrophile on the ligand and a nucleophilic center in the protein. Although this approach offers a variety of potential benefits (high potency and extended duration of action), concerns over the possible toxicological consequences of prot",
