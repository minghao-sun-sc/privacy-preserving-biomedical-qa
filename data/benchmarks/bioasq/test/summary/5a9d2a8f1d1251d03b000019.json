  "question": "What is INCB3619?",
  "ideal_answer": "INCB3619, is avselective, potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of a subset of ADAM proteases that prevents the processing and activation of multiple ErbB ligands, including heregulin. In addition, INCB3619 inhibits gefitinib-resistant HER3 signaling and enhances gefitinib inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC. Administration of INCB3619 to tumor-bearing mice reduced ErbB ligand shedding in vivo and inhibited ErbB pathway signaling (e.g., phosphorylation of Akt), tumor cell proliferation, and survival.",

      "text": "INCB3619 was identified as a representative selective, potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of a subset of ADAM proteases that block shedding of ErbB ligands. Administration of INCB3619 to tumor-bearing mice reduced ErbB ligand shedding in vivo and inhibited ErbB pathway signaling (e.g., phosphorylation of Akt), tumor cell proliferation, and survival. Further, INCB3619 synergized with clinically relevant cancer therapeutics and showed no overt or compounding toxicities, including fibroplasia, the dose-limiting toxicity associated with broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitors.",
