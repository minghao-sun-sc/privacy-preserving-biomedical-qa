  "question": "What is SHAPE-Seq?",
  "ideal_answer": "SHAPE-Seq is a high-throughput technique that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. SHAPE-Seq has the ability to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems. SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is a 'universal' method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase priming site within the RNA. It is a highly reproducible method, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE methods. SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is expected to be broadly applicable to understanding the RNA sequence-structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most fundamental processes.",

      "text": "This article contains a protocol for selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and sequencing (SHAPE-Seq) that, through a combination of structure-dependent chemical probing and next-generation sequencing technologies, achieves structural characterization of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment. This protocol is applicable in a variety of conditions, and represents an important tool for understanding RNA biology. The protocol includes methods for the design and synthesis of RNA mixtures for study, and the construction and analysis of structure-dependent sequencing libraries that reveal structural information of the RNAs in the mixtures. The methods are generally applicable to studying RNA structure and interactions in vitro in a variety of conditions, and allows for the rapid characterization of RNA structures in a high-throughput manner.",
