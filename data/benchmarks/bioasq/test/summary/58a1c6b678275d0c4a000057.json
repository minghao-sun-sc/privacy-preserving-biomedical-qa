  "question": "What is the major difference between eucaryotes and procaryotes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Eucaryotes have a nucleolus, Procaryotes do not. Eucrayotes have a nuclear membrane, organelles and differ in transcription and translation. Procaryotes have polycistronic RNA and the initiation of protein synthesis proceeds with an initiator tRNA which is found to be modified (formylated) in procaryotes and not in eucaryotes. ",
