  "question": "What is the Fenton reaction",
  "ideal_answer": "The Fenton reaction is a chemical reaction between hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst such as iron(III) salts, which produces a mixture of hydroxyl radicals and oxygen radicals. The reaction is used in the field of biochemistry to detect the presence of hydrogen peroxide in a sample.",

Since the Fenton reaction is fast, easy to set up, cheap, and biocompatible, this unique chemistry is",
