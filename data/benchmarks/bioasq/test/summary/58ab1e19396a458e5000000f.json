  "question": "What is the function of yeast Clr4 on chromatin?",
  "ideal_answer": "Clr4 is known to regulate silencing and switching at the mating-type loci and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres. The Clr4 methyltransferase determines the subnuclear localization of the mating-type region in fission yeast. Heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast depends on the Clr4 histone methyltransferase, which targets H3K9.",
