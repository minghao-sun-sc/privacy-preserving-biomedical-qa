  "question": "What is the role of the Mediator in gene expression?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating the expression of most RNA polymerase II transcripts. In particular, it functions by relaying signals from transcription factors (TFs) directly to the RNA polymerase enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by TFs) to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression).\n\nMediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing.",
