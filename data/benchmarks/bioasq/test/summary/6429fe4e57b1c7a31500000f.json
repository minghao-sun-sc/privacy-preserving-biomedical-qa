  "question": "What are coactivators?",
  "ideal_answer": "Coactivators are diverse and multifunctional proteins that act downstream of DNA-binding activators to stimulate transcription. Their functions can be broadly divided into two classes: (a) adaptors that direct activator recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus, (b) chromatin-remodeling or -modifying enzymes.\n\nThus, coactivators increase gene expression by binding to a transcription factor, recruiting other transcription factors and cofactors, and stabilizing the RNA polymerase enzyme to ensure that it can pass the promoter and begin transcribing the coding sequence.",
