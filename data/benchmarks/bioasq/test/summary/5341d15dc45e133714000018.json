  "question": "What is the definition of autophagy?",
  "ideal_answer": "There are several definitions of autophagy. Among them, autophagy can be defined as a non- apoptotic programmed cell death that consists on a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation.",
