  "question": "What is known about PAI-1 in longevity in humans?",
  "ideal_answer": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular senescence. In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear.\n, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.",
