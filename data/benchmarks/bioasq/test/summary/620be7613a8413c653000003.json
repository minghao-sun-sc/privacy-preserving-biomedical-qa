      "text": " Here, we demonstrate that Silencing Defective 2 (SDE2) is both an RNA binding protein and also a trans-acting adaptor protein that functions to regulate RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis. SDE2 depletion leads to widespread changes in alternative splicing, defects in ribosome biogenesis and ultimately complete loss of cell viability. Our data highlight SDE2 as a previously uncharacterized essential gene required for the assembly and maturation of the complexes that carry out two of the most fundamental processes in mammalian cells.",
