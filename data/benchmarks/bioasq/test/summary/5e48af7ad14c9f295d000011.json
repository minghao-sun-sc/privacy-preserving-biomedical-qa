  "question": "Is eculizumab effective for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome?",
  "ideal_answer": "In a clinical trial eculizumab did not achieve primary outcome for Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, because this was a small study without statistical comparison with the placebo group, the efficacy and safety of eculizumab could be investigated in larger, randomised controlled trials.",
