  "question": "Describe the usefulness of CAMUR in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)",
  "ideal_answer": "CAMUR is a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification model, calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes an ad-hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool. Three different types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach Cancer) were analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and CAMUR and its models were validated also on non-TCGA data. Experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR by obtaining several reliable equivalent classification models, from which the most frequent genes, their relationships, and the relation with a particular cancer are deduced.",
