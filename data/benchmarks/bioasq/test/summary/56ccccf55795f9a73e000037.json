  "question": "What is the role of NETs in systemic lupus erythematosus?",
  "ideal_answer": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released via a novel form of cell death called NETosis. NETs, consisting of a chromatin meshwork decorated with antimicrobial peptides, play an important role in the innate response to microbial infections. Clearance of NETs is impaired in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and NETosis is increased in these patients low-density granulocytes, a phenotype that correlates with disease activity. NETs are composed of secreted chromatin that may act as a source of autoantigens typical for SLE. NETs can directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis.",
