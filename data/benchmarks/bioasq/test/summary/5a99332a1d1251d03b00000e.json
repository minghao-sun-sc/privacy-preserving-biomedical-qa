  "question": "How is Hsd17b1 associated with endometriosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis.  Inhibition of the estradiol-synthesizing enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) has been proposed as a promising new therapeutic option to treat estrogen-dependent diseases like endometriosis",
