  "question": "Elaborate on the link between conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) and fractality.",
  "ideal_answer": "Well-developed fractality is revealed for the chromosomal distribution of different classes of CNEs in the human genome by employing the scaling of block entropy and box-counting. This is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution. There are also power-law-like distributions, i.e. linearity in double logarithmic scale, in the inter-CNE distances, a feature which is connected with fractality and self-similarity.",

We employed two methodologies: the scaling of block entropy and box-counting, with the aim to assess fractal characteristics of different CNE datasets. Both approaches converged to the conclusion that well-developed fractality is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution.
