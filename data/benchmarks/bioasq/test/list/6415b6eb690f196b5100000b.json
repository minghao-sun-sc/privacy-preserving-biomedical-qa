  "question": "What processes do orexin/hypocretin neurons regulate?",
  "ideal_answer": "Orexin/hypocretin neurons regulate wakefulness/sleep cycles, pain perception, appetite, food intake, reward system, and energy homeostasis. They also mediate goal-directed behaviors. Antagonists that target both orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors have been shown to promote sleep initiation and maintenance.",
