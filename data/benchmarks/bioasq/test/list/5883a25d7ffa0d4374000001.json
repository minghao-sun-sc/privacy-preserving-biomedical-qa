  "question": "What are the roles of Smyd3 in zebrafish?",
  "ideal_answer": "Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish. Transcripts of smyd3 are expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages and knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. In addition, these phenotypes are associated with abnormal expression of three heart-chamber markers including cmlc2, amhc and vmhc, and abnormal expression of myogenic regulatory factors including myod and myog.",
