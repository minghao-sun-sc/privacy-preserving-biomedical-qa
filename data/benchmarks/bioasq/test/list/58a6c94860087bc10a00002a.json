  "question": "Which histone mutations have been associated with pediatric gliomas?",
  "ideal_answer": "About 80% of Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cases and 70% of midline glioblastomas contain a mutation at one allele of the H3F3A gene (encoding histone H3 variant H3.3), replacing the lysine 27 with methionine (K27M). Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome. Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1)",
