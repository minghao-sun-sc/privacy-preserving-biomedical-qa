  "ideal_answer": "Mycros are the first inhibitors of c-Myc/Max dimerization, which have been demonstrated to inhibit DNA binding of c-Myc with preference over other dimeric transcription factors in vitroMost Myc inhibitors prevent the association between Myc and its obligate heterodimerization partner Max via their respective bHLH-ZIP domainsPreviously we showed that two c-Myc-Max inhibitors, 10058-F4 and 10074-G5, bound to distinct ID regions of the monomeric c-Myc bHLHZip domainWe tested the efficacy of Mycro3, a small-molecule inhibitor of Myc-Max dimerizationIn a fluorescence polarization screen for the MYC-MAX interaction, we have identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MYC, KJ-Pyr-9, from a Kr\u00f6hnke pyridine libraryWe have previously demonstrated that the small molecule 10058-F4, known to bind to the c-MYC bHLHZip dimerization domain and inhibiting the c-MYC/MAX interaction, also interferes with the MYCN/MAX dimerization in vitro and imparts anti-tumorigenic effects in neuroblastoma tumor models with MYCN overexpressionWe developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression.Inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization by a small-molecule antagonist (IIA6B17) has been shown to interfere with MYC-induced transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that the functional inhibitors of the MYC family of oncoproteins have potential as therapeutic agents.",
