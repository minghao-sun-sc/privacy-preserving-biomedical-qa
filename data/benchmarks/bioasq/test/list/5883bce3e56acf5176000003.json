We apply PeakXus to ChIP-Nexus and ChIP-exo experiments performed both in Homo sapiens and in Drosophila melanogaster cell lines.",

Furthermore, we developed bespoke methods to estimate the width of the protected region resulting from protein-DNA binding and to infer binding positions from ChIP-nexus data. Finally, we applied our peak calling method as well as the two other methods MACE and MACS2 to the available ChIP-nexus data.",
