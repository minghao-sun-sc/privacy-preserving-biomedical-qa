  "question": "What factors are associated with severe COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "Several factors have been associated with severe COVID-19. Age is a significant risk factor, with older adults being more likely to experience severe symptoms and require hospitalization. Individuals with underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are also at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Additionally, male sex has been identified as a risk factor for severe disease. Other factors that may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 include smoking history and immunocompromised status. It is important to note that while these factors have been associated with increased risk of severe disease, anyone can develop severe COVID-19 regardless of age or underlying health conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to continue practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing to reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations.",
