  "ideal_answer": "Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital disorder which results from failure of cleavage or incomplete differentiation of the forebrain structures at various levels or to various degrees . Depending on the degree of involvement, it is classified into 4 types: Alobar, Semilobar, Lobar, and Middle interhemispheric fusion variant .",
