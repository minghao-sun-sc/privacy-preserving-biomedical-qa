  "question": "Which transcription factors are involved in E-cadherin repression during EMT?",
  "ideal_answer": "Downregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression. Overexpression of Snail1 (Snail), Snail2 (Slug), Zeb1, Twist, SIP1 and DeltaEF1 have been found to mediate E-cadherin repression, induce the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin, and finally promote the migratory and invasive capabilities in cancer cells.",
