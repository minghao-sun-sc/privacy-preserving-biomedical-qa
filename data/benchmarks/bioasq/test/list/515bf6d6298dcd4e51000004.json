  "question": "Which forms of cancer is the Tpl2 gene associated with?",
  "ideal_answer": "Tpl2/Map3K8, also known as tumor progression locus 2 has been identified as an oncogene, its mutation or overexpression is reported in a variety of human cancers. Types of cancer associated with Tpl2 include skin and epithelial cancers, ADI prostate cancer, gastric and colon adenocarcinomas, colitis-associated cancer (CAC), breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas and several types of T-cell neoplasias.",
