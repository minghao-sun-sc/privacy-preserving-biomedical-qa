  "question": "Which are the main methods for pharmacophore modelling?",
  "ideal_answer": "A pharmacophore describes the arrangement of molecular features a ligand must contain to efficaciously bind a receptor. Pharmacophore models are developed to improve molecular understanding of ligand\u2013protein interactions, and can be used as a tool to identify novel compounds that fulfil the pharmacophore requirements and have a high probability of being biologically active. Protein structure-based pharmacophores (SBPs) derive these molecular features by conversion of protein properties to reciprocal ligand space. Unlike ligand-based pharmacophore models, which require templates of ligands in their bioactive conformation, SBPs do not depend on ligand information.",

      "text": "protein interactions are becoming increasingly significant as potential drug targets; however, the rational identification of small molecule inhibitors of such interactions remains a challenge. Pharmacophore modelling is a popular tool for virtual screening of compound libraries, and has previously been successfully applied to the discovery of enzymatic inhibitors. However, the application of pharmacophore modelling in the field of protein:protein interaction inhibitors has historically been considered more of a challenge and remains limited. In this review, we explore the interaction mimicry by known inhibitors that originate from in vitro screening, demonstrating the validity of pharmacophore mapping in the generation of queries for virtual screening. We discuss the pharmacophore mapping methods that have been successfully employed in the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors. ",

While they have been applied for years on common drug targets, their application in the discovery of protein-protein interaction inhibitors remains limited. This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions. We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes. This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures. We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets.",

The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by various methods such as test set, decoy set and Cat-Scramble methodology. The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen several small-molecule databases, including Specs, NCI, ChemDiv and Natural product databases to identify the potential dual ACC inhibitors. The virtual hits were then subjected to several filters such as estimated [Formula: see text] value, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis.",

The model also maps well to the external test set molecules as well as clinically active molecules and corroborates the docking studies.
