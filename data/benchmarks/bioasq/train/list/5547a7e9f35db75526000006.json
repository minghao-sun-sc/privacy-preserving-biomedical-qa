  "question": "Which enzymes are involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) in bacteria?",
  "ideal_answer": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is universally used to recognize and remove many types of DNA damage. In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase.  Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Subsequently, UvrA, UvrB and UvrC form the excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, a multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. In some cases, Cho may be the effective nuclease for NER, rather than UvrC. UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase. In gram-positive organisms, PcrA helicase can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex.",

RESULTS: Inactivation of any of the four uvr genes strongly increased the susceptibility of H. pylori to DNA damage by ultraviolet light. Inactivation of uvrA and uvrB significantly decreased mutation frequencies whereas only the uvrA deficient mutant exhibited a significant decrease of the recombination frequency after natural transformation. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold increase) into the recipient chromosome. A deletion of uvrD induced a hyper-recombinational phenotype.",

Lesions targeted by TCR are repaired more quickly than lesions repaired by the transcription-independent \"global\" NER pathway, but the mechanism underlying this rate enhancement is not understood. Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Bacterial TCR additionally requires the Mfd protein, a DNA translocase that removes the stalled transcription complexes.",
