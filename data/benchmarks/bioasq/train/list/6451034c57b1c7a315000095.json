      "text": "LS is due to a deficit of various respiratory chain and Krebs cycle enzymes resulting in insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in particular cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and complex I of the respiratory chain, which share an autosomal recessive and X-linked mode of transmission. Cases with maternal inheritance (MILS) are due to a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation.",
