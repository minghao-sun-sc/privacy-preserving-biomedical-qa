  "question": "What are the main indications of lacosamide?",
  "ideal_answer": "Lacosamide is an anti-epileptic drug, licensed for refractory partial-onset seizures. In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models. Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety.",
