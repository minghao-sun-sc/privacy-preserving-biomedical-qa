  "question": "Which are the types of Friedreich's Ataxia based on onset age?",
  "ideal_answer": "The most common type of FRDA is early-onset which has an average age of onset between 10 to 30 years old. \nThen we have mid-life-onset at around 40 years old. And lastly, there\u2019s very-late Onset at over 50 years old.",
