  "ideal_answer": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome is an inherited cancer syndrome defined by occurrence of multiple neuro-endocrine tumors and is classically associated with the combined occurrence of two or more tumors involving parathyroid gland, pancreas and pituitary gland. Other tumors, including but not limited to adrenal cortical tumor, carcinoid tumors lipoma, leiomyoma, duodenal gastrinoma, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and renal angiomyolipoma, angiofibroma, colagenoma, thyroid tumor and meningioma, may also be present.",
