  "question": "What histone marks are indicative of enhancers in the chromatin landscape of a given cell?",
  "ideal_answer": "H3K4me1 marks where enhancers are in the chromatin landscape. By further identifying H3K27Ac on the same histone, we can determine whether the enhancer is active or inactive. Finally, H3K4me3 is a predominant feature of active promoters, but detectable levels of this modification are also observed at active enhancers.",

Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state.",
