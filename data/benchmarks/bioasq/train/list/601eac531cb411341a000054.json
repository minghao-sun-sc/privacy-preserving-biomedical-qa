Appropriate and timely evaluation, diagnosis, objective testing, and evidence-based decisions regarding treatment options are paramount in the optimal care of the patient with this pathology. An understanding of current literature is critical in determining and understanding best practices.RECENT FINDINGS: A thorough review of the recent literature regarding physical examination, diagnostic testing, and nonoperative versus operative results was performed. Regarding physical examination, the glenohumeral internal rotation test and scratch collapse test are more effective and sensitive than traditional maneuvers such as Tinel's testing and the elbow flexion test.",
