  "question": "Mutation of which gene and which chromosome cause Neurofibromatosis type I?",
  "ideal_answer": "Neurofibromatosis Type I is an autosomal dominant condition associated with NF-1 gene mutation that is located in the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q11.2). In the majority (95%) of Neurofibromatosis Type I individuals, the mutation is found in the NF1 gene, while the remaining 5% of the patients have different types of genetic abnormalities.\n",
