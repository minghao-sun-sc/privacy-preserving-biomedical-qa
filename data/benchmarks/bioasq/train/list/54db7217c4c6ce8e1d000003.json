  "question": "How many and which are the different isoforms for the ryanodine receptor?",
  "ideal_answer": "Generally, three ryanodine receptor isoforms (RyR1-RyR3) are known. RyR1, expressed in skeletal muscle; RyR2, expressed in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, expressed in various cells. RyR3 is preferentially expressed in the brain especially in the hippocampus and striatum.",

This process is predominantly controlled by Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor. This very large protein (MW 560 kDa) exists as a homotetramer (~2.2 MDa) and is expressed in three isoforms: RyR1, expressed in skeletal muscle; RyR2, expressed in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, expressed in various cells at lower levels than the other isoforms.
