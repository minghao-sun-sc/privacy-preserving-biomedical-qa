  "ideal_answer": "Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies and accompanying reductions in cost have led to an explosion of techniques to examine chromatin accessibility genome-wide. Generally, accessible regions of chromatin are permissive for factor binding and are therefore hotspots for regulation of gene expression. Therefore, identification of these regions is critical for understanding regulatory mechanisms of gene expression associated with various biological processes in eukaryotes.\n\nCurrently, high-throughput methodologies, such as DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, FAIRE-seq, and MNase-seq have been widely applied in mapping open chromatin in various eukaryotic genomes.",

Identification of CREs is critical for understanding regulatory mechanisms of gene expression associated with various biological processes in eukaryotes.

Currently, high-throughput methodologies, such as DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and FAIRE-seq, have been widely applied in mapping open chromatin in various eukaryotic genomes.
