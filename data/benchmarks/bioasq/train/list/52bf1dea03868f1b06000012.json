  "question": "What are the side effects of Nalmefene?",
  "ideal_answer": "Side effects of nalmefene include nausea, dizziness / lightheadedness, insomina, fatigue, vomiting, reduced caloric intake / apetite, increased self-rated alertness and decreased tiredness. In horses some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and mild sedation has been described. In some studies nalmefene was well tolerated by all subjects, and no clinically significant adverse effects were observed.",

      "text": "Thus the apparent nutrient specificity of nalmefene appeared to be an indirect consequence of its effect on palatability. Nalmefene also caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for observed changes in eating behaviour.",
