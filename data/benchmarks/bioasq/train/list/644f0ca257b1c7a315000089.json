  "question": "What are the hallmarks of cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "The hallmarks of cancer are a set of characteristics that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, as proposed by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg in their seminal paper published in 2000. These hallmarks include: 1) sustained proliferative signaling, which allows cancer cells to continuously divide and grow; 2) evasion of growth suppressors, enabling them to bypass cellular mechanisms that inhibit uncontrolled growth; 3) resistance to cell death, allowing them to avoid apoptosis or programmed cell death; 4) replicative immortality, granting them the ability to maintain telomeres and divide indefinitely; 5) induction of angiogenesis, promoting the formation of new blood vessels for nutrient supply; and 6) activation of invasion and metastasis, enabling the spread of cancer cells to other tissues. In a later update in 2011, two emerging hallmarks were added: 7) reprogramming of energy metabolism, which shifts cellular metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect); and 8) evading immune destruction by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, two enabling characteristics were identified: genome instability and mutation, leading to genetic alterations that drive cancer progression; and tumor-promoting inflammation, which supports tumor growth and survival. Understanding these hallmarks is crucial for developing targeted therapies against various types of cancers.",

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction.",
