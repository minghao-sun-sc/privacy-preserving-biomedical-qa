  "question": "What are the known families of deadenylases?",
  "ideal_answer": "All known deadenylases belong to either the DEDD or the exonuclease\u2013endonuclease\u2013phosphatase (EEP) superfamily. Members of DEDD include the POP2, CAF1Z, PARN and PAN2 families. Members of EEP include the CCR4, Nocturnin, ANGEL and 2'-PDE families.",
