  "question": "What are the most common mutation locations in dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy?",
  "ideal_answer": "The most common mutation locations in dystrophin gene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are the distal hotspot exons, specifically exons 47, 48, and 50. Additionally, mutations in the proximal portion of the gene not involving Dp140 have been found to be less severe. Duplications spanning one or more exons are also a common cause of the disease.",
