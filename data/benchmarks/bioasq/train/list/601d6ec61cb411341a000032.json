      "text": "Mutations in the TRIM8 gene have been described in patients with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Only six patients have been described to date. All the previous mutations were truncating variants clustered in the C-terminus of the protein. A previous patient with TRIM8-related epileptic encephalopathy was reported to have nephrotic syndrome. Here we describe the clinical, radiological and histological features of an 8-year-old male patient with a TRIM8 mutation who, in contrast to previous patients, had only mild intellectual disability and well-controlled epilepsy. The patient was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age. Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His kidney function declined and peritoneal dialysis was started at 5 years of age. He underwent renal transplant at 7 years of age. Trio-based whole genome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912.2) c.1198_1220del, p.(Tyr400ArgfsTer2). This patient is further evidence that TRIM8 mutations cause a syndrome with both neurological and renal features. Our findings suggest the spectrum of TRIM8-related disease may be wider than previously thought with the possibility of milder neurodevelopmental problems and/or a more severe, progressive renal phenotype. We highlight the need for proteinuria screening in patients with TRIM8 mutations.",
