      "text": "To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a scRNA-seq data dimensionality reduction algorithm based on a hierarchical autoencoder, termed SCDRHA. The proposed SCDRHA consists of two core modules, where the first module is a deep count autoencoder (DCA) that is used to denoise data, and the second module is a graph autoencoder that projects the data into a low-dimensional space. Experimental results demonstrate that SCDRHA has better performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms on dimension reduction and noise reduction in five real scRNA-seq datasets. Besides, SCDRHA can also dramatically improve the performance of data visualization and cell clustering.",
