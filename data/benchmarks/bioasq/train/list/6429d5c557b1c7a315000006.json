  "question": "What are the major thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "Patients with severe COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk of developing major thrombotic complications. These complications include venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents such as stroke. In a study involving 2928 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 34% of ICU-managed patients, with DVT reported in 16.1% and PE in 12.6%, despite anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Another study found that one-third of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 developed macrovascular thrombotic complications. However, it is important to note that critically ill COVID-19 patients are also at risk for major life-threatening bleeding events, particularly when systemic anticoagulation is used. Balancing the risks of thrombotic complications and bleeding events remains a challenge in managing these patients.",
