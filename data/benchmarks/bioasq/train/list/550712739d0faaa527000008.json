  "question": "Which mutations in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been found to be related to CPVT?",
  "ideal_answer": "Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. A novel RyR2-V2475F mutation is associated with CPVT in humans. 3 CPVT mouse models are: RyR2-R2474S+/-, RyR2-N2386I+/-, and RyR2-L433P+/-. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT. A knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation is the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families. Scanning of 12 Finnish CPVT probands identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals. Three CPVT-linked human RyR2 (hRyR2) mutations are: S2246L, N4104K, and R4497C.",

The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays. The S4153R mutation enhanced propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and reduced SOICR threshold but did not alter Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding, a common feature of other CPVT gain-of-function RYR2 mutations. We conclude that the S4153R mutation is a gain-of-function RYR2 mutation associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by both CPVT and atrial fibrillation.",

Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT.",
