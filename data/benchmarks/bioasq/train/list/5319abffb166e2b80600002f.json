  "question": "Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?",
  "ideal_answer": "EMT is characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology, and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from the cellular cortex. A number of growth factors have been shown to be involved in this process. These include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, TNF-\u03b1, CCN family, Sonic Hedgehog (SHh), Notch1, GF-\u03b2, Wnt, EGF, bFGF, IGF-I and IGF-II.",
