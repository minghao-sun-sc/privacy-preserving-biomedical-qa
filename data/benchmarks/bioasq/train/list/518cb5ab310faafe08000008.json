  "question": "Which are the best treatment options to treat Helicobacter pylori?",
  "ideal_answer": "The best treatment options  for eradication of Helicobacter pylori involve triple or quadruple drugs therapy with different types of antibiotics.\nBismuth may be also an additional option. Proton pump inhibitors are also included in treatment.\nThe more effective drug list includes: amoxicillin, claritromycin, metronidazole rifabutin.\nAlso chitosan microspheres with Eudragit L100 have been tested.",
