  "ideal_answer": "Different ways have been used to try to reverse Tau hyperphosphorylation through administration of inhibitors such as: 7-nitroindazole,  memantine, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitors. \nOther approaches are transplantation of Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and administration of M1 muscarinic agonists.",
