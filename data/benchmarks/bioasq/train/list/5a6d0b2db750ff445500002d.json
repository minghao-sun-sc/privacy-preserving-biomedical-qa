      "text": "Using Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos and Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that the E3 ligase CUL-2LRR-1associates with the replisome and drives ubiquitylation and disassembly of CMG, together with the CDC-48 cofactors UFD-1 and NPL-4. Removal of CMG from chromatin in frog egg extracts requires CUL2 neddylation, and our data identify chromatin recruitment of CUL2LRR1as a key regulated step during DNA replication termination. Interestingly, however, CMG persists on chromatin until prophase in worms that lack CUL-2LRR-1, but is then removed by a mitotic pathway that requires the CDC-48 cofactor UBXN-3, orthologous to the human tumour suppressor FAF1.",
