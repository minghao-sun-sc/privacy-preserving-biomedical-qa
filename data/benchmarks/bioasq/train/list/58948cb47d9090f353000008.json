  "question": "Which are the key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells?",
  "ideal_answer": "Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas specify embryonic radial glial cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation.",
