  "question": "Which proteins constitute the methyl-directed mismatch repair system (MMR) in bacteria?",
  "ideal_answer": "The mismatch repair system (MMR) recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases caused mainly by DNA polymerase, and contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication in living cells. In bacteria, the methyldirected mismatch repair (MMR) is comprised of MutS and MutL proteins, encoded by the mutS/L operon.",
