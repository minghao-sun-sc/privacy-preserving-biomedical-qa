  "question": "What are the main clinical components of the brain death exam?",
  "ideal_answer": "The three essential findings in brain death are coma, absence of brain stem reflexes by neurologic exam including ancillary testing, and apnea. Studies can highlight the variability in practice in regard to the AT and supports the use of ancillary tests to determine BD in patients. Coma and brain stem reflexes can be determined by several ancillary tests  Ancillary tests include electroencephalography,  brainstem auditory evoked potentials, included somatosensory evoked potentials, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, conventional cerebral angiography, and  nuclear medicine flow study",
