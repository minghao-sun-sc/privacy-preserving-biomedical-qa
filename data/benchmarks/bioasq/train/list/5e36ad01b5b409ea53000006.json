The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. PTEN levels were detected by Western blotting. Anti-tumor effects of uc.160 were further explored in tumor transplantation models.RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively. Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, uc.160 positively regulated the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. Interestingly, uc.160 was inhibited by microRNA miR-155 that is also a negative regulator of gastric cancer.CONCLUSION: uc.160 is significantly down-regulated in gastric carcinomas and can inhibit the tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that uc.160 may be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of gastric malignancies.",

      "text": "BACKGROUND: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved among the orthologous regions in most vertebrates. It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.",

      "text": "We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.",
