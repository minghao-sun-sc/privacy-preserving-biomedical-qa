      "text": "Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability.
