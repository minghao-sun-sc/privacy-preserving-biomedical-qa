  "ideal_answer": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Overexpression of one specific T-UCRs named uc.63 is associated with bad outcome in luminal A subtype of breast cancer patients. Uc.38 negatively regulates the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affects the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis.",

      "text": "We found that overexpression of one specific T-UCRs named uc.63 is associated with bad outcome in luminal A subtype of breast cancer patients. uc.63 is localized in the third intron of exportin-1 gene (XPO1) and is transcribed in the same orientation of its host gene. Interestingly, silencing of uc.63 induces apoptosis in vitro. However, silencing of host gene XPO1 does not cause the same effect suggesting that the transcription of uc.63 is independent of XPO1. Our results reveal an important role of uc.63 in promoting breast cancer cells survival and offer the prospect to identify a signature associated with poor prognosis.",

Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis. Describing the uc.38/PBX1 axis has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer apoptosis and has suggested that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
