  "question": "Which are the methods for in silico prediction of the origin of replication (ori) among bacteria?",
  "ideal_answer": "Several in silico methods have been applied for prediction of the origin of replication (ori). DNA base composition asymmetry, such as GC skew, is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the ori in prokaryotes. The Z curve analysis is also used for ori identification. Comparative genomics, by BLAST analyses of the intergenic sequences compared to related species have been applied in ori prediction. The finding of the dnaA gene and its binding sites, DnaA boxes, as well as the finding of the binding sites of other proteins, such as CtrA and IHF, are fundamental characteristics used for in silico prediction of the ori. Also, the localization of boundary genes, such as cell division cycle (cdc6) gene, and consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences have been employed for ori detection. The study of the gene order around the origin sequence and the distribution of the genes encoded in the leading versus the lagging strand are also used for in silico detection of the ori.",
