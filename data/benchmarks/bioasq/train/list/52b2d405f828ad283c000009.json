  "question": "Which cell types are known to be driving Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Macrophages, T cells and their respective cytokines play a pivotal role in RA. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) constitute a quite unique cell type that distinguishes RA from other inflammatory conditions of the joints. Activated synovial fibroblasts (SFs) have the ability to invade joint cartilage, actively contributing to joint destruction in RA.",
