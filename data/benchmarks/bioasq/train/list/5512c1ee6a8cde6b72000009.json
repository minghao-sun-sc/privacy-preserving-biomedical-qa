  "question": "Which proteins are the different isoforms of the p38 MAP kinase?",
  "ideal_answer": "The p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is one of the best characterized kinases in the inflammatory process. There are four isoforms of the enzyme (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta), which differ in tissue distribution, regulation of kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream substrates. Among the four identified p38 isoforms (p38\u03b1, p38\u03b2, p38\u03b3, and p38\u03b4), the \u03b1-form is the most fully studied.",
