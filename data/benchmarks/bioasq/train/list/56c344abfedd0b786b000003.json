  "question": "What are the properties of super-enhancers?",
  "ideal_answer": "Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation. In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification. Super-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity.",
