  "question": "What are the effects of ILK ablation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Depending on the tissue or cell where ILK is ablated we see different effects:\nAblation of ILK in heart results in dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous heart failure\nAblation of ILK in fibroblasts leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts\nAblation of ILK in osteoclasts inhibits bone resorption\nAblation of ILK in liver results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration and in abnormal histology\nAblation of ILK in podocytes caused an aberrant distribution of nephrin and alpha-actinin-4",
