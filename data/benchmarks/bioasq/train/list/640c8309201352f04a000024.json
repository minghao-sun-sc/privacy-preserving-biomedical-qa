  "question": "The diagnosis of cholestasis is based on the elevations seen in what liver function tests?",
  "ideal_answer": "Cholestasis is due to  an excess of bile in the liver  and is often due to a biliary obstruction. There are  disproportionate elevations in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Serum bilirubin. In Cholestasis of pregnancy,  an elevation of the serum bile acids  is often seen",
