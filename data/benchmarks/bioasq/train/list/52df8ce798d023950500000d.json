  "question": "Which are the supplemental antioxidant in athletes?",
  "ideal_answer": "There are several antioxidant supplements belonging to different families, i.e. Vitamins, Polyphenols, alpha-lipoic acid, ubiquinones, n-3- polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs), minerals and others. Nonetheless the widespread use of these supplements, it is still debated their true usefulness, and it is not unanimously advised their use in athletes.",
