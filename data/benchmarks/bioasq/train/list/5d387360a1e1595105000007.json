  "question": "What are the effects of CAMK4 inhibition?",
  "ideal_answer": " Here, we present evidence that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) is increased and required during Th17 cell differentiation. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator a (CREM-a) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling",
