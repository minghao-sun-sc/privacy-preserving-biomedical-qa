  "question": "When modifying histones with either activating or repressing marks, such as with acetyl and methyl groups, histone acetyltransferases and histone methyltransferases normally modify which amino acids?",
  "ideal_answer": "Histones are almost always modified on lysines or arginines. Acetylation normally is an activating mark, and methylation is normally a repressing mark of chromatin structure.",
