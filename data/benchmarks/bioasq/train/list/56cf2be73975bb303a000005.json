  "question": "What do mepolizumab and reslizumab have in common?",
  "ideal_answer": "Mepolizumab and reslizumab are monoclonal antibodies that target and neutralize interleukin 5. They have been shown to reduce eosinophil counts and they are used for the treatment of refractory asthma (associated with eosiniphilia) and other eosinophilic diseases.",
