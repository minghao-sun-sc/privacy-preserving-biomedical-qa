UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-\u03b1 mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and p50. ",

In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation.",
