  "question": "In which aspects of the immune response is m6A methylation implicated?",
  "ideal_answer": "m6A is a novel regulator of immune system homeostasis and activation.  m6A modifications and m6A modifying proteins play a critical role in pathogen recognition, immune cell activation, immune cell fate decisions, and immune reactions. These modifications modulate the fate decisions of innate and adaptive immune cells and regulate immune responses in immune-associated diseases, including viral infections and cancer.",
