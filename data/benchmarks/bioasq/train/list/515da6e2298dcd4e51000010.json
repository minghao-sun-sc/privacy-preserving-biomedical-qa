  "ideal_answer": "It is unclear if any treatment is registered for pediatric use. The reported treatments are:\nOxcarbazepine \nOpioids alone, in rotations  or with Analgesics (e.g. Ketamine and Lidocaine infusion)\nOpioids and Benzodiazepines\nPregabalin -  is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

The opioid was rotated either for excessive side effects with adequate analgesia (70%), excessive side effects with inadequate analgesia (16.7%), or tolerance (6.7%). Five (23%) children required two rotations, 3 during the same admission. The favored rotations were morphine to fentanyl in 20 (67%) children and fentanyl to hydromorphone in 6 (20%). Adverse opioid effects were resolved in 90% of cases, all failures occurred when morphine was rotated to fentanyl.",

We retrospectively reviewed our experience using intravenous (IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at Stanford. Eight children (aged 5-16.6 years), who were unable to tolerate medications by the oral route, received IV amitriptyline for a variety of indications, including neuropathic pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and as an adjuvant agent for opioid analgesia.",
