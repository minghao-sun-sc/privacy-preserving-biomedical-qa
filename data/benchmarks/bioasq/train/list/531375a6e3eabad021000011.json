  "ideal_answer": "The following risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified: 1) previous cardiac arrest; 2) sustained ventricular tachycardia; 3) family history of sudden cardiac death; 4) high-risk genetic mutations; 5) unexplained syncope; 6) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 7) hypotensive response to exercise; 8) marked left ventricular hypertrophy; 9) J-wave on ECG and 10) myocardial fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement",
