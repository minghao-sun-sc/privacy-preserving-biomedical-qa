  "question": "In which tissues is the lincRNA Xist expressed?",
  "ideal_answer": "Relative expression of X-linked genes was examined in liver, kidney and brain tissue by real-time PCR in adult XX(Y)* and XY* males and XX females. X-chromosome inactive specific transcript (Xist) was expressed only in female adipose tissue. X-chromosome inactive specific transcript (Xist) was expressed only in female adipose tissue. It was also expressed in duodenum and testis.",
