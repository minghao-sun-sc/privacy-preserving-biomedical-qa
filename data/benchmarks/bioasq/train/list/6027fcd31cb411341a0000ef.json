      "text": "Elementary flux modes (EFMs) analysis constitutes a fundamental tool in systems biology. However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge. We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs.RESULTS: Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time. We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-OR Linear program Solver (CLP).",

      "text": "Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are a key tool for analyzing genome-scale metabolic networks, and several methods have been proposed to compute them. Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs.RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver. We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.",
