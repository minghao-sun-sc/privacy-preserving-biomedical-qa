  "question": "Which proteins control the degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in yeast?",
  "ideal_answer": "Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome. ",
