  "question": "Which signaling pathways have been associated with medulloblastoma formation and growth?",
  "ideal_answer": "Medulloblastoma comprises approximately 20% of all primary pediatric brain tumors. Multiple signaling pathways have been associated with disease formation and growth. These include the developmental pathways Hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt, as well as pathways in which the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) c-Met, erbB2, IGF-R and TrkC, and the oncoprotein Myc are involved.",
