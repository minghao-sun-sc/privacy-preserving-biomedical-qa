  "question": "What are the necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA to a mature\nmRNA?",
  "ideal_answer": "The transition from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to mature mRNA involves several critical processing steps. Firstly, the 5'-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes capping, which helps protect the transcript from degradation and facilitates translation initiation. Next, RNA splicing occurs, where introns are removed and exons are joined together to generate a continuous coding sequence. This process can create diverse mature mRNA molecules from a limited number of genes through alternative splicing events that include or exclude specific introns and exons. Finally, the 3'-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes cleavage and polyadenylation, adding a poly(A) tail that enhances stability and promotes nuclear export. Once these processing steps are complete, the mature mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation into proteins by ribosomes.",
