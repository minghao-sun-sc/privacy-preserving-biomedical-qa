  "ideal_answer": "According to guidelines palivizumab is available for treatment of RSV-induced bronchiolitis in high-risk infants: born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab reduces the burden of bronchiolitis but does not prevent infection.",
