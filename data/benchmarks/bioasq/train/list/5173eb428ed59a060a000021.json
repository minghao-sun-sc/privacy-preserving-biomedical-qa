  "question": "What type of cancers and inherited diseases have been associated to mutations in the Notch pathway?",
  "ideal_answer": "So far, mutations in Notch and other components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers,  Multiple Sclerosis,  CADASIL,  Alagille Syndrome,  Spondylocostal Dysostosis), but more pathologies are likely to be associated with Notch in the future due to its network complexity.",
