  "ideal_answer": "Mutation in casein kinase 1 epsilon results in a short circadian period, abnormal entrainment to light cycles, and potentiated resetting responses to light.\nMutations of CK1epsilon found in breast cancer can suppress Wnt/beta-catenin as well as promote the Wnt/Rac-1/JNK and Wnt/NFAT pathways, thus contributing to breast cancer development via effects on cell adhesion and migration.\nCsnk1e is regulating not only the timing of sleep, but also the REM sleep amount and NREM sleep architecture.",
