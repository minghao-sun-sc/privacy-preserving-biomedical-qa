  "ideal_answer": "Even when other body sites are affected, pyoderma gangrenosum usually affects the upper and lower legs and feet or peristomal sites compared with chronic venous ulcers that are limited to the lower legs and feet. (2) Pyoderma gangrenosum can be associated with systemic diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease. (4) Crater-like holes or cribriform scarring is commonly seen in pyoderma gangrenosum but not in chronic venous ulcers.",
