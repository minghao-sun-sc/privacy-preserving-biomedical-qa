  "question": "Which myosin isozymes are located within the pericuticular necklace of the hair cell?",
  "ideal_answer": "The hair cell is located in the inner ear, a tissue that is particularly reliant on actin-rich structures and unconventional myosin isozymes. Within the pericuticular necklace, a domain of the hair cell, certain unconventional myosin isozymes are located, namely myosins-Ibeta, myosin-VI, and myosin-VIIa.",
