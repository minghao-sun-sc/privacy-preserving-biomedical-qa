  "ideal_answer": "The clinical characteristics of isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy are excessively thickened endocardial layer with deep intertrabecular recesses (with ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium >2), heart failure, syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, complete left branch conductive block, sick sinus syndrome and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia",
