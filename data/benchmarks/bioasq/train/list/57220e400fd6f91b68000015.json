  "question": "Which are the most common symptoms in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome?",
  "ideal_answer": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by proximal limb muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased deep-tendon reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. There are 2 forms of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: one most frequently associated with small-cell lung cancer (P-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and the other that is a pure autoimmune form (NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome)",

      "text": "LEMS weakness typically involves lower and upper limbs and the proximal muscles are predominantly affected. A significant proportion of patients also have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. LEMS recognition is based on clinical, electrophysiological and immunological criteria. Nearly 50-60% of patients with LEMS have an underlying tumour that, in almost all cases, is a small-cell lung cancer;",
