  "question": "Which cellular functions are affected by lncRNA H19 in the heart?",
  "ideal_answer": "H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3. Elevated H19 promotes apoptosis through PA2G4. Downregulation of H19 promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. H19 induces mineralization of valve interstitial cells. H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.",
