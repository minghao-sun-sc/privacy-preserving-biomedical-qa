  "question": "Which human syndromes have been detected with Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)?",
  "ideal_answer": "To explore the clonal evolution of monosomy 7 in patients with aplastic anemia (AA).Monosomy 7 (-7) in 81 AA patients with normal karyotype at diagnosis and 46 AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and more than 6 months of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) were detected by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) retrospectively.There were 5.4% - 7.6% of -7 cells in 11 (13.6%) of 81 patients at diagnosis, the survival and response rate to IST in -7 positive patients did not differ s Former molecular cytogenetic studies showed that such aberrations as an equivalent of intrinsic radiosensitivity can be detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques using whole chromosome painting (wcp) probes. Five-color FISH was performed using human DNA segments specific for peri-CEN or subTEL, which were labeled with five different fluorescent dyes [7-diethylaminocoumarin (DEAC): blue, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC): green, rhodamine 6G (R6G): yellow, TexRed: red, and cyanine5 (Cy5): purple]. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis.",
