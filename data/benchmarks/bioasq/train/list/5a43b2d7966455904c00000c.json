  "question": "Which are the best methods for the prediction of circular RNA (circRNA)?",
  "ideal_answer": "A circRNA prediction software for plants . Circular RNA profile in gliomas revealed by identification tool UROBORUS. Numerous algorithms that are used to detect genome-wide circRNA expression from RNA sequencing  data have been developed in the past few years, but there is little overlap in their predictions and no clear gold-standard method to assess the accuracy of these algorithms. MiARma-Seq: a comprehensive tool for miRNA, mRNA and circRNA analysis. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance.
