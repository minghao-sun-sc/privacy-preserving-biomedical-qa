  "question": "Which extra thyroid tissues have thyrotropin (TSH) receptors?",
  "ideal_answer": "TSH receptors are expressed also in extrathyroid tissues. TSH receptors seem to be functional. Extrathyroid tissues include fibrobasts of the orbit and adipose tissue\nThe principal tissues with TSH receptors are:\nadippose tissue\n orbital fibrotic tissue",
