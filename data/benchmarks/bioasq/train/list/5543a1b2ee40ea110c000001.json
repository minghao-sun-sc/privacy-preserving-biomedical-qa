  "question": "In what type(s) of plant organelles we can detect prolamellar bodies?",
  "ideal_answer": "Prolamellar body (PLB) is a highly organized lipid structure, which is the main site of accumulation of the ternary light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase:protochlorophyllide). Prolamellar bodies have been discovered in etioplasts with the use of thin section electron microscopy. Etioplasts develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark. During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms the photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes. Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) efficiently capture the light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. Upon illumination, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts. PLBs are formed not only in etioplasts but also in chloroplasts in young developing leaves during the night.",
