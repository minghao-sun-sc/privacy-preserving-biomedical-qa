  "question": "What type of data does the UK biobank resource contain?",
  "ideal_answer": "The UK Biobank contains deep phenotyping and genomic data. A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, including biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records. Genome-wide genotype data have been collected on all participants, providing many opportunities for the discovery of new genetic associations and the genetic bases of complex traits.",
