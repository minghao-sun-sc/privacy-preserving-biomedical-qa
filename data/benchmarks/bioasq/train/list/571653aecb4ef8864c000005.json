  "question": "Which are the most common methods for ctDNA (circulating tumour DNA) detection?",
  "ideal_answer": "Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. The practice of \"liquid biopsy\" as a diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic tool in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is an appealing approach, at least in theory, since it is noninvasive and easily repeated. Cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA. A new DNA sensor using a nickel(II) phenanthroline complex ([Ni(phen)(2)PHPIP]\u00b72ClO(4)) as the electrochemical probe was developed. The sensor is very sensitive and selective for calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) detection in aqueous medium.",
