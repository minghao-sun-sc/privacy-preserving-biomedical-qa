  "question": "Which histone modifications are correlated with transcription elongation?",
  "ideal_answer": "This is accompanied by reductions in the level of H3K36 trimethylation, a posttranslational histone modification associated with efficient transcriptional elongation, and the number of full-length transcripts from these genes. The 3' ZNF exons contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation.",
