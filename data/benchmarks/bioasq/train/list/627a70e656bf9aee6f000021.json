  "question": "What laboratory abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "Common laboratory abnormalities among patients with COVID-19 include:\n\n1. Elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).\n2. Elevated aminotransaminase levels (i.e., AST, ALT).\n3. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.\n4. Lymphopenia, leucocytosis.\n\nAbnormalities in coagulation testing (e.g., increased D-Dimers, decreased platelets), elevated procalcitonin levels, and elevated troponin levels have also been reported. The degree of these abnormalities tends to correlate with disease severity.",
