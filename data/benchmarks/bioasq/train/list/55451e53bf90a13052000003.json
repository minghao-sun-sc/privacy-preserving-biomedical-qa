  "question": "Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER or TCR) is a cellular process by which UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand are restored. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd (Mutation frequency decline), an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Mfd is the major transcription repair coupling factor in bacteria. Also, the transcription elongation factor NusA, in addition to its role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription,  promotes an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion.",

      "text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions.",
