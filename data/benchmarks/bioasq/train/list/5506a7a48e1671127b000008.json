  "question": "Which protein phosphatases have been found to dephosphorylate phospholamban?",
  "ideal_answer": "The protein phosphatases which dephosphorylate native, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-associated phospholamban were studied in cardiac muscle extracts and in a Triton fraction prepared by detergent extraction of myofibrils, the latter fraction containing 70-80% of the SR-associated proteins present in the tissue. At physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ (1 mM), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) accounted for approximately 70% of the total phospholamban phosphatase activity in these fractions towards either Ser-16 (the residue labelled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PK-A) or Thr-17 (the residue phosphorylated by an SR-associated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) accounted for the remainder of the activity.  ",

      "text": "These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide.",
