  "question": "What are the outcomes of ubiquitination?",
  "ideal_answer": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that generally directs proteins for degradation by the proteasome or by lysosomes. However, ubiquitination has been implicated in many other cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and regulation of protein-protein interactions.",
