  "question": "List five applications of machine learning algorithms in medical diagnosis.",
  "ideal_answer": "Machine learning technology is well suited for the induction of diagnostic and prognostic rules and solving of small and specialized diagnostic and prognostic problems. The medical diagnostic knowledge can be automatically derived from the description of cases solved in the past. In several medical domains we actually applied machine learning algorithms. Typically, the automatically generated diagnostic rules achieved the same or slightly better diagnostic accuracy than physicians specialists. There many several  application of machine learning algorithms in medical diagnosis such as Brain glioma progression, Microarray classification, Mass spectral proteomics, Lymph disease classification and Parkinson's disease.",

      "text": "Mass spectrometry based proteomics technologies have allowed for a great progress in identifying disease biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, they face acute challenges from a data reproducibility standpoint, in that no two independent studies have been found to produce the same proteomic patterns. Such reproducibility issues cause the identified biomarker patterns to lose repeatability and prevent real clinical usage. In this work, we propose a profile biomarker approach to overcome this problem from a machine-learning viewpoint by developing a novel derivative component analysis (DCA)",
