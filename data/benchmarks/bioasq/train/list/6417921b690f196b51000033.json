  "question": "What are common symptoms in female carriers of DMD?",
  "ideal_answer": "Female carriers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) may experience muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Common symptoms include pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles, muscular weakness, compensatory movements, and longer timed performance on functional tasks. Some female carriers may also present with asymmetrical muscle weakness.",
