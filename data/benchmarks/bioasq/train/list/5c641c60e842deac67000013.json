  "question": "Which databases can exchange data using Matchmaker Exchange's API?",
  "ideal_answer": "Matchmaker Exchange (MME) was created to establish a federated network connecting databases of genomic and phenotypic data using a common application programming interface (API). To date, seven databases can exchange data using the API: GeneMatcher, PhenomeCentral, DECIPHER, MyGene2, matchbox, Australian Genomics Health Alliance Patient Archive, and Monarch Initiative; the latter included for model organism matching.",
