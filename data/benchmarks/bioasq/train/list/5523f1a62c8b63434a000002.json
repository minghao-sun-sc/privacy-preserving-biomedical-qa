  "question": "Which mutations of phopspholamban have been found in patients with cardiomyopathy?",
  "ideal_answer": "PLN mutation R14del [or c.40_42delAGA(p.Arg14del)] was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients. Another PLN mutation is a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), and it was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. Hereditary mutants of phospholamban, such as Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.in specific, two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L).One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death.",

      "text": "Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.",
