  "question": "Which drugs have been found effective for the treatment of chordoma?",
  "ideal_answer": "Established chordoma cell lines, and patient-derived primary cell cultures, as well as chordoma tumors in vivo were found to be sensitive to treatment with bortezomib, vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, fludarabine and SD-1029 Stat3 inhibitor. Moreover, percutaneous intratumoral injection with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion was shown to be effective against chordoma. It should be stressed that combination treatment with the use of the above drugs was always able to increase the therapeutic potency.",

Etoposide and cisplatin, each at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, reduced the percentage of viable chordoma cells in a more effective way when given with 1 \u03bcM ATRA simultaneously, reducing the number of viable cells to 14% and 9%, respectively.",
