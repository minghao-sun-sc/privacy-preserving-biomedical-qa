  "question": "Which T-UCRs have been implicated in lung cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) classified as long non-coding RNAs (Lnc-RNAs) are transcripts longer than 200-nt RNA with no protein-coding capacity. The clinicopathologic significance and regulatory mechanism of T-UCRs in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. Uc.454 is downregulated in both non-small-cell LC (NSCLC) tissues and LC cell lines, and the downregulated uc.454 is associated with tumor size and tumors with more advanced stages. Transfection with uc.454 markedly induces apoptosis and inhibites cell proliferation in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H2170 LC cell lines. Thus uc.454 potentially plays a suppressive role in LC. Transcribed uc.339 is upregulated in archival NSCLC samples, functioning as a decoy RNA for miR-339-3p, -663b-3p, and -95-5p. As a result, Cyclin E2, a direct target of all these microRNAs is upregulated, promoting cancer growth and migration. Modulation of uc.339 affects microRNA expression. However, overexpression or downregulation of these microRNAs causes no significant variations in uc.339 levels.",

      "text": "Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) classified as long non-coding RNAs (Lnc-RNAs) are transcripts longer than 200-nt RNA with no protein-coding capacity. Previous studies showed that T-UCRs serve as novel oncogenes, or tumor suppressors are involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progressive. Nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and regulatory mechanism of T-UCRs in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. We found that uc.454 was downregulated in both non-small-cell LC (NSCLC) tissues and LC\u00a0cell lines, and the downregulated uc.454 is associated with tumor size and tumors with more advanced stages. Transfection with uc.454 markedly induced apoptosis and\u00a0inhibited cell proliferation in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H2170 LC cell lines. Above results suggested that uc.454 played a suppressive role in LC. Heat shock protein family\u00a0A member 12B (HSPA12B) protein was negatively regulated by uc.454 at the posttranscriptional level by dual-luciferase reporter assay and affected the expressions of Bcl-2 family members, which finally induced LC apoptosis. The uc.454/HSPA12B axis furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor apoptosis, which may potentially serve as a therapeutic target for lung carcinoma.",

      "text": "The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) encode long non-coding RNAs implicated in human carcinogenesis. Their mechanisms of action and the factors regulating their expression in cancers are poorly understood. Here we show that high expression of uc.339 correlates with lower survival in 210 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We provide evidence from cell lines and primary samples that TP53 directly regulates uc.339. We find that transcribed uc.339 is upregulated in archival NSCLC samples, functioning as a decoy RNA for miR-339-3p, -663b-3p, and -95-5p. As a result, Cyclin E2, a direct target of all these microRNAs is upregulated, promoting cancer growth and migration. Finally, we find that modulation of uc.339 affects microRNA expression. However, overexpression or downregulation of these microRNAs causes no\u00a0significant variations in uc.339 levels, suggesting a type of interaction for uc.339 that we call \"entrapping\". Our results support a key role for uc.339 in lung cancer.",
