  "question": "Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA?",
  "ideal_answer": "The 7-methylguanosine cap added to the 5\u2032 end of mRNA is essential for efficient gene expression and cell viability. Methylation of the guanosine cap is necessary for the translation of most cellular mRNAs in all eukaryotic organisms in which it has been investigated. In some experimental systems, cap methylation has also been demonstrated to promote transcription, splicing, polyadenylation and nuclear export of mRNA. In the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA involved the RNA polymerase II, RNA guanylyltransferase and RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase enzymes.",

We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein). RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability.",
