  "ideal_answer": "Autophagy (Autophagy-related protein 8 or Atg8p or APG8 or AUT7 or CVT5) is a yeast protein involved in cytoplasm to vacuole transport (Cvt) vesicles and autophagosomes formation. In yeast it is represented by a single gene, the ATG8 family in humans contains 6 members (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3A (MAP1LC3A), MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3C, GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2/GATE-16).",
