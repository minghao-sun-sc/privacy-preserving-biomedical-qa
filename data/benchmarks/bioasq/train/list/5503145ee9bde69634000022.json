Although a large proportion of thyroid cancers belong to well differentiated histologic subtypes, which in general show a good prognosis after surgery and radioiodine ablation, the treatment of radio-resistant papillary-type, of undifferentiated anaplastic, and of medullary-type thyroid cancers remains unsatisfactory",

FDG-PET/CT may help in defining the extent of disease in some patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma and rising postoperative calcitonin levels",
