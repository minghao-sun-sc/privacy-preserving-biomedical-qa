  "question": "List places in the body where somatostatin is produced.",
  "ideal_answer": "Somatostatin is a cyclic peptide well known for its strong regulatory effects throughout the body. Also known by the name of growth hormone inhibiting hormone, it is produced in many locations, which include the olfactory bulb, hair follicles, pancreas, retina, and central nervous system (CNS).",
