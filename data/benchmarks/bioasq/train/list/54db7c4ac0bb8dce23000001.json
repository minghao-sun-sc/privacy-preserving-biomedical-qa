  "question": "Which protein kinases have been found to phosphorylate Phospholamban and affect its biological activity?",
  "ideal_answer": "Phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 is mainly mediated by PKA and at Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Phospholamban is also a reporter for PKG activity and akt kinase interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr(17).",
