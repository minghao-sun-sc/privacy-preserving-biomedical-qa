  "question": "What forms part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP?",
  "ideal_answer": "The diverse arrays of proteins secreted by senescent cells have been described to influence aging and to have both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic influences on the surrounding microenvironment. Further characterization of these proteins, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and their regulators is required to understand and further manipulate such activities. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is characterized by IL1B, CXCL8, CCL2, TNF, CCL27 and other pro-inflammatory factors including a novel SASP component CLEC11A.",
