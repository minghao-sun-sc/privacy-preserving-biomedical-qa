      "text": "Repeat expansions are responsible for over 40 monogenic disorders, and undoubtedly more pathogenic repeat expansions remain to be discovered. Existing methods for detecting repeat expansions in short-read sequencing data require predefined repeat catalogs. Recent discoveries emphasize the need for methods that do not require pre-specified candidate repeats. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide repeat expansion detection. Analysis of real and simulated data shows that our method can identify large expansions of 41 out of 44 pathogenic repeats, including nine recently reported non-reference repeat expansions not discoverable via existing methods.",

      "text": "We describe a novel computational method for genotyping repeats using sequence graphs. This method addresses the long-standing need to accurately genotype medically important loci containing repeats adjacent to other variants or imperfect DNA repeats such as polyalanine repeats. Here we introduce a new version of our repeat genotyping software, ExpansionHunter, that uses this method to perform targeted genotyping of a broad class of such loci.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ExpansionHunter is implemented in C++ and is available under the Apache License Version 2.0. The source code, documentation, and Linux/macOS binaries are available at https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter/.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
