The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days.
