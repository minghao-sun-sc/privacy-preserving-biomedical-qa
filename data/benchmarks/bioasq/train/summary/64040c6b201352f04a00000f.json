  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of Tolebrutinib?",
  "ideal_answer": "Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), expressed in B cells and cells of innate immunity, including microglia, is an essential signaling element downstream of the B-cell receptor and Fc-receptors. Tolebrutinib is a potent BTK inhibitor that covalently binds the kinase, resulting in durable inhibition with the potential to target inflammation in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Tolebrutinib crosses the blood-brain barrier and potently inhibits BTK in microglial cells isolated from the CNS.",
