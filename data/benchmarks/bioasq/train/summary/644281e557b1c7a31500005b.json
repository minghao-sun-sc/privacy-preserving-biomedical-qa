  "ideal_answer": "FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2)  have different genetic causes but are phenotypically indistinguishable. FSHD1 is caused by a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of DUX4. FSHD type 2 (FSHD2) is due to mutations in SMCHD1 with resulting hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of DUX4.",
