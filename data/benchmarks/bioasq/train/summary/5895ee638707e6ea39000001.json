  "ideal_answer": "MiRduplexSVM is a high-performing miRNA-duplex prediction and evaluation methodology. It's a method that combines a unique problem representation and an unbiased optimization protocol to learn from mirBase19.0 an accurate predictive model. It is the first model that provides precise information about all four ends of the miRNA duplex.",
