  "question": "What is the function of a protein degron?",
  "ideal_answer": "Protein degrons are part of the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional transcription factors.  Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine residues that targets them to the proteolytic machinery. Disruption of one degron by a RNA-binding protein causes it to become ubiquitinated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus.",
