  "question": "What are there sex differences in SAMHD1 activity?",
  "ideal_answer": "The host restriction factor SAMHD1 exists in a hyperphosphorylated, less active state in male-derived macrophages. SAMHD1 is an essential modulator of infectivity in a sex-dependent manner in macrophages, constituting a novel component of sex differences in innate immune control of HIV-1.",

      "text": "Investigations into the mechanism governing these sex-dependent differences revealed that the host restriction factor SAMHD1 exists in a hyperphosphorylated, less active state in male-derived macrophages. In addition, the major kinase responsible for SAMHD1 phosphorylation, CDK1, exhibited lower levels of expression in female-derived macrophages in all tested donor pairs. The sex-dependent differences in viral restriction imposed by SAMHD1 were abrogated upon its depletion. We conclude that SAMHD1 is an essential modulator of infectivity in a sex-dependent manner in macrophages, constituting a novel component of sex differences in innate immune control of HIV-1.",
