  "question": "What is the role of the Leucosporidium ice-binding protein",
  "ideal_answer": "Arctic yeast Leucosporidium sp. produces a glycosylated ice-binding protein (LeIBP) with a molecular mass of \u223c25 kDa, which can lower the freezing point below the melting point once it binds to ice. ce-binding proteins (IBPs) inhibit ice growth through direct interaction with ice crystals to permit the survival of polar organisms in extremely cold environments.",
