  "ideal_answer": "DiseaseEnhancer is a manually curated resource of human disease-associated enhancer catalog. As of July 2017, DiseaseEnhancer includes 847 disease-associated enhancers in 143 human diseases. Database features include basic enhancer information (i.e. genomic location and target genes); disease types; associated variants on the enhancer and their mediated phenotypes (i.e. gain/loss of enhancer and the alterations of transcription factor bindings).",
