  "question": "What is the association between kidney donation risk of gestational complications?",
  "ideal_answer": "Kidney donation seems to elevate the risks of gestational complications. Postdonation pregnancies were associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, proteinuria and preeclampsia. However, others reported that donor nephrectomy is not detrimental to the prenatal course or outcome of future pregnancies.",
