  "question": "What is the role of enhancers in cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Enhancers are regulatory elements that control gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter region. In cancer, enhancers can play a critical role in driving oncogenic transcriptional programs by activating genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Enhancer activation can occur through various mechanisms, including genetic alterations such as amplifications or translocations, epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation or DNA methylation, and aberrant signaling pathways. Recent studies have shown that enhancer hijacking is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer, where non-coding mutations can create de novo enhancers or redirect existing ones to drive oncogenic gene expression. Targeting enhancer-driven transcriptional programs has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, with several ongoing clinical trials testing small molecule inhibitors of key transcriptional regulators or chromatin modifiers involved in enhancer regulation.",

      "text": "Recent advances in genome-wide analyses have revealed that the deregulation of distal gene regulatory elements, such as enhancers, appears in several pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. Beyond the conventional function of enhancers in recruiting transcription factors to gene promoters, enhancer elements are also transcribed into noncoding RNAs known as enhancer RNAs (eRNA). Accumulating evidence suggests that uncontrolled enhancer activity with aberrant eRNA expression promotes oncogenesis. Interestingly, tissue-specific, transcribed eRNAs from active enhancers can serve as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers in several cancer types.",

They are recognized by sequence-specific transcription factors, which in turn recruit transcriptional coactivators that facilitate transcription by promoting assembly and activation of the basal transcriptional machinery. Their functional importance is underscored by the fact that they are often the target of genetic and nongenetic events in human disease that disrupt their sequence, interactome, activation potential, and/or chromatin environment. Dysregulation of transcription and addiction to transcriptional effectors that interact with and modulate enhancer activity are common features of cancer cells and are amenable to therapeutic intervention.",

One of their most important functions is the integration of extracellular signals with intracellular cell fate information to generate cell type-specific transcriptional responses. Mutations occurring in cancer often misregulate enhancers that normally control the signal-dependent expression of growth-related genes. This misregulation can result from trans-acting mechanisms, such as activation of the transcription factors or epigenetic regulators that control enhancer activity, or can be caused in cis by direct mutations that alter the activity of the enhancer or its target gene specificity. These processes can generate tumour type-specific super-enhancers and establish a 'locked' gene regulatory state that drives the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.",
