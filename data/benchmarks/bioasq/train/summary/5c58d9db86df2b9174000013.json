      "text": "While tools have been developed to identify biological processes that are enriched in the genes sets, there remains a need for tools that identify enrichment of tissue-specific genes. Therefore, we developed TissueEnrich, a tool that calculates tissue-specific gene enrichment in an input gene set. We demonstrated that TissueEnrich can assign tissue identities to single cell clusters and differentiated embryonic stem cells.Availability: The TissueEnrich web application is freely available at http://tissueenrich.gdcb.iastate.edu/.
