  "ideal_answer": "in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN, the CNN had both higher sensitivity and specificity.",
