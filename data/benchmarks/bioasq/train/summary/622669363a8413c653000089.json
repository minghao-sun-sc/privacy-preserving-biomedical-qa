  "question": "What is the role of PCAT6 in human cancers?",
  "ideal_answer": "PCAT6, is a carcinogenic lncRNA. It is abnormally elevated in various human malignant tumors. PCAT6 has been found to sponge various miRNAs to activate the signaling pathways, which further affects tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, apoptosis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. It is believed to have diagnostic and prognostic value and clinical applications in various human malignancies.",

      "text": "Emerging evidence has shown that PCAT6, a newly discovered carcinogenic lncRNA, is abnormally elevated in various human malignant tumors. Until now, PCAT6 has been found to sponge various miRNAs to activate the signaling pathways, which further affects tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, apoptosis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. Moreover, PCAT6 has been shown to exert biological functions beyond ceRNAs. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics of PCAT6 in a variety of human malignancies and describe the biological mechanisms by which PCAT6 can facilitate tumor progression. Finally, we discuss its diagnostic and prognostic values and clinical applications in various human malignancies.",
