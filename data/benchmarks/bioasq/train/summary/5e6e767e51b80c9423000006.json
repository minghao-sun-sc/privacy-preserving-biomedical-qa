  "ideal_answer": "The first autosomal dominant mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene was described in 1991. Later, AD was also associated with mutated early-onset (presenilin 1/2, PSEN1/2 and APP) and late-onset (apolipoprotein E, ApoE) genes. Genome-wide association and linkage analysis studies with identified multiple genomic areas have implications for the treatment of AD.\nThe Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, an international family-clustered registry to study autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease which is a rare form of Alzheimer disease caused by mutations in any of the three genes including the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2.",

We estimate the accuracy of several cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in differentiating three diagnostic and genetic populations: normal non-mutation carriers, asymptomatic mutation carriers, and symptomatic mutation carriers.",
