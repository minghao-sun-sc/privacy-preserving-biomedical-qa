  "question": "Endolymphatic hydrops is associated with Meniere\u2019s disease. Please provide a summary of endoymphatic hydrops including the symptoms and affected body part.",
  "ideal_answer": "Endolymphatic hydrops is a disorder of the inner ear. It consists of an excessive build-up of the endolymph fluid, which fills the hearing and balance structures of the inner ear. The symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops include the feeling of pressure or fullness in the ears, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and balance problems.",

      "text": "Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) can be studied in patients by MRI. With the semi-quantitative grading system, previous imaging studies showed discrepancies in the occurrence and grading of EH in patients with Meniere's disease (MD). Here, we compared the inversion of the saccule to utricle area ratio (SURI) with the semi-quantitative method of grading conventionally used to diagnose MD.METHODS: Imaging was carried out on a 3-T MRI scanner. We performed 3D-FLAIR sequences 4\u00a0h after a single intravenous dose of contrast agent. Two radiologists independently studied the morphology of the inner ear structures in the healthy subjects and MD patients. ",
