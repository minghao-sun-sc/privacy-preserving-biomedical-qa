  "question": "Can DMSO as an additive improve proteomic analysis results?",
  "ideal_answer": "Quantitative precisions improved significantly when DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) was added to the matrix solution.\nIntroducing to the 80% formic acid injection solution an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or acetonitrile-DMSO induced further retention selectivity, and increasing levels of organic solvents reduced on-column retention.\nLow percentages of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in liquid chromatography solvents lead to a strong enhancement of electrospray ionization of peptides, improving the sensitivity of protein identification in bottom-up proteomics by up to tenfold.",
