  "question": "What is pyroptosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death triggered by certain inflammasomes, leading to the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and activation of inactive cytokines like IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2. Pyroptosis has been reported to be closely associated to some diseases like atherosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, some studies found that pyroptosis can influence the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of tumor, which regulated by some non-coding RNAs and other molecules.",
