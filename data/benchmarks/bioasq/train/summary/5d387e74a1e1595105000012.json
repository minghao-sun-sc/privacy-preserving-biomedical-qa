  "ideal_answer": " Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique.",

Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations. ",
