  "question": "What is the efficacy of oxaliplatin monotherapy in the management of colorectal cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Oxaliplatin is a promising treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. It appears to be particularly advantageous (in terms of response rate and duration of progression-free survival) when used in combination with fluorouracil/calcium folinate as both a first- and second-line option, although preliminary studies have failed to show any survival advantage over fluorouracil/calcium folinate alone. Promising results have been found in studies of the drug as monotherapy, and oxaliplatin may also prove useful in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with unresectable liver metastases; however, data are limited at present",
