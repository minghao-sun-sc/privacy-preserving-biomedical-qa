  "ideal_answer": "Isolated perfusion of the heart with a Ca2+-free perfusate followed by a Ca2+-containing perfusate causes dramatic alterations in the physiology and biochemistry of the tissue, a phenomenon known as the calcium paradox. A similar paradoxical effect of Ca2+ has also been reported to occur in the kidney  When isolated rat hearts are perfused with Ca2+-containing medium, after a brief Ca2+-free period, irreversible cell damage occurs (calcium paradox). This phenomenon is concomitant with a rapid consumption of myocardial high-energy phosphate stores, prior to the appearance of these compounds in the effluent perfusion medium.   ",
