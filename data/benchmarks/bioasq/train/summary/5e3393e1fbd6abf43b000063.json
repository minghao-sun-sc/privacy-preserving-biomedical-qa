  "question": "What is the goal of the RadRAT calculator?",
  "ideal_answer": "Radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",
