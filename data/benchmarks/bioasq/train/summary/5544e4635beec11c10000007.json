  "question": "What is the idea behind the fractal globule that has been proposed as a model of chromatin conformation in the nucleus of a cell?",
  "ideal_answer": "The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). The fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model and emphasizes topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories.",
