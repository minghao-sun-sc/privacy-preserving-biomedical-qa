  "question": "What is the relationship between nucleosomes and exons?",
  "ideal_answer": "Nucleosomes are preferentially located within exons compared to nearby intronic sequences. Preferential positioning within the exons is indepedent of gene expression levels, stronger in exons with weak splice sites and conserved through metazoan evolution.",
