  "question": "What are apoptotic bodies?",
  "ideal_answer": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles released into the extracellular space by almost all types of cells. EVs can cross the physiological barriers, and a variety of biological fluids are enriched in them. EVs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies.\nApoptotic bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death.",
