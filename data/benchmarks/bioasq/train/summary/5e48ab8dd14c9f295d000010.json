      "text": "Based on our knowledge of pathophysiology, three therapeutic strategies are proposed: anti-inflammatory (ocrelizumab, siponimod\u2026); remyelinating (opicinumab); and neuroprotective (high-dose biotin, ibudilast, simvastatin\u2026). Nevertheless, despite recent promising positive clinical trials, new methodological approaches for therapeutic protocols with adaptable outcomes to assess progression are still needed.",
