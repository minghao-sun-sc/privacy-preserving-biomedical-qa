  "question": "What does VBP15 do to skeletal muscle?",
  "ideal_answer": "VBP15 protects and promotes efficient repair of skeletal muscle cells.  Potent inhibition of NF-\u03baB is mediated through protein interactions of the glucocorticoid receptor, however VBP15 shows significantly reduced hormonal receptor transcriptional activity. In DMD model mice it improves muscle strength, live-imaging and pathology through both preventive and post-onset intervention regimens.",

      "text": "We find VBP15 protects and promotes efficient repair of skeletal muscle cells upon laser injury, in opposition to prednisolone. Potent inhibition of NF-\u03baB is mediated through protein interactions of the glucocorticoid receptor, however VBP15 shows significantly reduced hormonal receptor transcriptional activity. The translation of these drug mechanisms into DMD model mice improves muscle strength, live-imaging and pathology through both preventive and post-onset intervention regimens. These data demonstrate successful improvement of dystrophy independent of hormonal, growth, or immunosuppressive effects, indicating VBP15 merits clinical investigation for DMD and would benefit other chronic inflammatory diseases.",
