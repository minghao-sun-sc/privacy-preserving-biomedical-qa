  "question": "What is the risk for secondary cancer after proton beam therapy?",
  "ideal_answer": "Proton beam therapy is associated with lower risk of secondary cancer when compared to other radiation therapy approaches. It allows excellent dose localization by administration of a high dose to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues. Therefore it is more commonly used in children.",
