      "text": "Carpal tunnel syndrome commonly results in loss of visualization of the nerve fascicular pattern on US images. To assess this phenomenon, we developed a nerve-tissue contrast index (NTI) method. The NTI is a ratio of average brightness levels of surrounding tissue and the median nerve, both calculated on the basis of a US image. The area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and t test were used to assess the usefulness of the features for differentiation of patients with CTS from control participants",
