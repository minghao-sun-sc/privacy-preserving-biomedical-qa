  "question": "Is trastuzumab associated cardiotoxicity reversible?",
  "ideal_answer": "Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect of trastuzumab, manifesting as either an asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF). Reduction of cardiac function by trastuzumab is mostly reversible, however, some patients, especially those with cardiac risk factors, may rarely experience chronic heart failure or prolonged left ventricular ejection fraction reduction.",
