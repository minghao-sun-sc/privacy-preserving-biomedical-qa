      "text": "For the phagocytic assay, fluorescein conjugated polystyrene beads were incubated with macrophage monolayers in white luminostrips. After incubation, cells were washed, lysed and phagocytosis quantified by determining the fluorescent intensity using a fluorescence plate reader. The number of beads phagocytized was determined from a standard curve of bead number versus fluorescent output.",
