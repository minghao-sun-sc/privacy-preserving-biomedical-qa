  "question": "What does the term \"homeotic transformation\" mean?",
  "ideal_answer": "Homeotic transformation refers to the process of transforming one body part into the likeness of another body part. This process is usually caused by mutations in highly conserved Hox genes, which play a crucial role in embryonic patterning across animal phyla. The study of homeotic-transformation mutants in model organisms such as Drosophila has revolutionized the field of developmental biology",

      "text": "The discovery of the broad conservation of embryonic regulatory genes across animal phyla, launched by the cloning of homeotic genes in the 1980s, was a founding event in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). While it had long been known that fundamental cellular processes, commonly referred to as housekeeping functions, are shared by animals and plants across the planet-processes such as the storage of information in genomic DNA, transcription, translation and the machinery for these processes, universal codon usage, and metabolic enzymes-Hox genes were different: mutations in these genes caused \"bizarre\" homeotic transformations of insect body parts that were certainly interesting but were expected to be idiosyncratic. The isolation of the genes responsible for these bizarre phenotypes turned out to be highly conserved Hox genes that play roles in embryonic patterning throughout Metazoa.",
