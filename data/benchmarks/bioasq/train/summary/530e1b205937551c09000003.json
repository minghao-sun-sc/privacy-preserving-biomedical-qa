  "question": "What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?",
  "ideal_answer": "The association between cell phone use and incident glioblastoma remains unclear. Some studies have reported that cell phone use was associated with incident glioblastoma, and with reduced survival of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. However, other studies have repeatedly replicated to find an association between cell phone use and glioblastoma.",
