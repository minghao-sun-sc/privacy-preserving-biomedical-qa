  "question": "What is MULTOVL?",
  "ideal_answer": "MULTOVL is an application suite that detects and statistically analyses multiple overlaps of genomic regions in a fast and efficient manner. The package supports the detection of multiple region intersections, unions and 'solitary' genomic regions. The significance of actually observed overlaps is estimated by comparing them with empirical null distributions generated by random shuffling of the input regions.",
