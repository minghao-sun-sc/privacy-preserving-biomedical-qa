  "question": "How does FTO suppress pancreatic tumorigenesis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Reduced expression of the m6A demethylase, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), was responsible for the high levels of m6A RNA modification in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, FTO demethylated the m6A modification of praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2 (PJA2), thereby reducing its mRNA decay, suppressing Wnt signaling, and ultimately restraining the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.",
