  "question": "What is golodirsen's mechanism of action?",
  "ideal_answer": "Golodirsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) designed to induce exon 53 skipping in pre-mRNA processing. This exon skipping restores the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD, resulting in the production of truncated but partially functional dystrophin, which can potentially slow down the progression of the disease.",
