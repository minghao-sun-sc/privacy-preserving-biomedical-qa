  "question": "What is known about type D personality trait in cancer patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "Reported prevalence rates of type D personality ranges from 19% to 22% in patients with cancer. In patients with cancer, Type D personality is associated with poor quality of life and mental health. Cancer patients with a Type D personality as compared with non-Type D patients perceive that they receive less information, report less satisfaction with the amount of received information, believe that their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. Also, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often influences them emotionally. Also, Type D cancer patients are at an increased risk for comorbidity burden and increased health care utilization.",

      "text": "RESULTS: Nineteen percent of patients (n=572) had a Type D personality. The perceived receipt of disease-specific (mean 46 vs. 51), medical test (56 vs. 63) and treatment information (37 vs. 42) was significantly lower for Type D patients compared with non-Type Ds as assessed with the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 (scales 0-100; all ps<0.01). Cancer patients with a Type D personality were less satisfied with the received information (49 vs. 58; p<0.01) and found the received information less useful (55 vs. 61; p<0.01) compared with non-Type Ds. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that Type D personality was independently associated with information about the disease (Beta=-0.09), medical tests (Beta=-0.12) and treatment (Beta=-0.08), and with satisfaction with information received (OR=0.54; 95%CI=0.44-0.66;all ps<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that patients with a Type D personality perceived that they received less information and reported less satisfaction with the amount of received information as compared with non-Type D patients.",

They believe their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness.

Differences regarding 'consequences', 'concern' and 'emotional response' were also clinically relevant.",

Multivariate analyses showed that Type D was negatively associated with 'coherence' and positively with 'consequences', 'timeline', 'identity', 'concern', and 'emotional representation'. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the associations between personality and illness perceptions, demonstrating their close interrelatedness. Our study may be helpful in further developing theoretical models regarding giving meaning to illness and the illness perceptions that the illness elicits. Future studies should investigate whether interventions can positively impact illness perceptions of Type D cancer patients.",

      "text": "RESULTS: Nineteen percent of survivors had a type D personality. Over a 12-month period, type D survivors significantly more often reported osteoarthritis, back pain, and depression than non-type D survivors. Also, type D survivors more often reported to feel bothered by high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, heart disease, depression, diabetes and lung disease during daily activities. Type D survivors more often visited their general practitioner than non-type D survivors (P<.001), also in relation to cancer (0 visits: 54% vs. 60%; 1-5: 28% vs. 22%; >5: 9% vs. 5%; P<.001), as well as their specialist (0 visits: 6% vs. 7%; 1-5 visits: 59% vs. 64%; >5 visits: 30% vs. 23%; P<.01). CONCLUSION: Type D personality is a vulnerability factor that may help to identify subgroups of cancer survivors who are at an increased risk for comorbidity burden and increased health care utilization.",

Additionally, they reported a statistically and clinically relevant higher impact of cancer on body changes, negative self-evaluation, negative outlook on life, life interferences and health worry. Furthermore, they were more worried about the influence of the sun on their skin and acted accordingly. No differences were found in health care utilisation. CONCLUSIONS: Type D personality has a distinct negative impact on health status in melanoma survivors and is an important factor to screen for in clinical practice. ",
