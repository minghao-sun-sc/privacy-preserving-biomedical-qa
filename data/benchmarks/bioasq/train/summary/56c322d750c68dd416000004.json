  "question": "What is the vibrational theory of olfaction?",
  "ideal_answer": "The vibrational theory of olfaction assumes that electron transfer occurs across odorants at the active sites of odorant receptors (ORs), serving as a sensitive measure of odorant vibrational frequencies, ultimately leading to olfactory perception. The theory proposes that olfactory receptors respond not to the shape of the molecules but to their vibrations. It differs from previous vibrational theories (Dyson, Wright) in providing a detailed and plausible mechanism for biological transduction of molecular vibrations: inelastic electron tunnelling. Thus, the authors, that have proposed this theory, suggest that olfaction, like colour vision and hearing, is a spectral sense.",
