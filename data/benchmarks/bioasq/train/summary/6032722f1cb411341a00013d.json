Targeting cancer cells with administration of bispecific antibodies and natural extracts results in elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-6, which lead to cell toxicity. Sustained release of cytokines due to immunotherapy or hormonal issues causes various diseases. Novel T cell-engaging therapies and monoclonal antibodies cause cytokine release syndrome. ",
