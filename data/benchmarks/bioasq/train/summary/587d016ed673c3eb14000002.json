  "question": "What is TOPAZ1?",
  "ideal_answer": "TOPAZ1 is a novel germ cell-specific expressed gene conserved during evolution across vertebrates. Its PAZ-domain protein is abundantly expressed in the gonads during germ cell meiosis. The expression pattern of TOPAZ1, and its high degree of conservation, suggests that it may play an important role in germ cell development. Further characterization of TOPAZ1 may elucidate the mechanisms involved in gametogenesis, and particularly in the RNA silencing process in the germ line.",
