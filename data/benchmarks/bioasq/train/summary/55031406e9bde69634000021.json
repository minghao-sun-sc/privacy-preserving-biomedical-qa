  "question": "What is the risk in G-CSF treatment for severe congenital neutropenia?",
  "ideal_answer": "Severe congenital neutropenia is a rare hematological condition causing severe chronic neutropenia. Treatment with the myeloid growth factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is usually effective, but the dose of G-CSF required to normalize blood neutrophils varies greatly. Ten to thirty percent of the patients evolve to develop acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, necessitating careful clinical monitoring.",

      "text": "We obtained serial hematopoietic samples from an SCN patient who developed AML 17 years after the initiation of G-CSF treatment. Next- generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations during disease progression. In the AML phase, we found 12 acquired nonsynonymous mutations. Three of these, in CSF3R, LLGL2, and ZC3H18, co-occurred in a subpopulation of progenitor cells already in the early SCN phase. This population expanded over time, whereas clones harboring only CSF3R mutations disappeared from the BM. The other 9 mutations were only apparent in the AML cells and affected known AML-associated genes (RUNX1 and ASXL1) and chromatin remodelers (SUZ12 and EP300). In addition, a novel CSF3R mutation that conferred autonomous proliferation to myeloid progenitors was found. We conclude that progression from SCN to AML is a multistep process, with distinct mutations arising early during the SCN phase and others later in AML development. The sequential gain of 2 CSF3R mutations implicates abnormal G-CSF signaling as a driver of leukemic transformation in this case of SCN",
