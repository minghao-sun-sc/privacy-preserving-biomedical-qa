  "ideal_answer": "UE2343 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant 11b-HSD1 inhibitor and selected for clinical studies. Reducing glucocorticoid exposure in the brain via intracellular inhibition of the cortisol-regenerating enzyme 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to treat cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). UE2343 is safe, well tolerated and reaches the brain at concentrations predicted to inhibit 11b-HSD1. UE2343 is therefore a suitable candidate to test the hypothesis that 11b-HSD1 inhibition in brain improves memory in patients with AD.",
