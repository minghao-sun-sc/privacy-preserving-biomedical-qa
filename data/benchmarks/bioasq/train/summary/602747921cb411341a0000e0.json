      "text": "TransCon CNP is a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-38) conjugated via a cleavable linker to a polyethylene glycol carrier molecule, designed to provide sustained systemic CNP levels upon weekly subcutaneous administration. TransCon CNP is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia. In both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, sustained exposure to CNP via TransCon CNP was more efficacious in stimulating bone growth than intermittent CNP exposure. TransCon CNP was well tolerated with no adverse cardiovascular effects observed at exposure levels exceeding the expected clinical therapeutic exposure. At equivalent dose levels, reductions in blood pressure and/or an increase in heart rate were seen following single subcutaneous injections of the unconjugated CNP-38 molecule or a daily CNP-39 molecule (same amino acid sequence as Vosoritide, USAN:INN).
