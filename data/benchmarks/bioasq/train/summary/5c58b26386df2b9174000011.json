  "question": "Describe the mechanism of action of ibalizumab.",
  "ideal_answer": "Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as post-attachment inhibitor by binding CD4 2nd domain of T lymphocyte and preventing HIV connection to CCR5 or CXCR4. It has been recently approved by Food and Drug Administration as a new intravenous antiretroviral agent for heavily treated HIV adults with multi -drug resistant infection.",
