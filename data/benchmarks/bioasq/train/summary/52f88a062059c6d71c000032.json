      "text": "Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was introduced as a prostate cancer screening tool more than 20 years ago. However, there is continuing debate regarding its utility in screening for prostate cancer. Mass screening is costly, may result in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers that never become clinically significant, and the evidence of a subsequent reduction in mortality is inconclusive. In addition to its role in screening, PSA is also used to monitor the progression of the disease, both localized and metastatic. Although the evidence is contradictory, PSA is still an important tool for monitoring patient progression following treatment of definitive localized prostate cancer.",
