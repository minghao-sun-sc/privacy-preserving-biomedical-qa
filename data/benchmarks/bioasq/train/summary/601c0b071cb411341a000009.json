  "question": "What is the mode of action of dexamethasone?",
  "ideal_answer": "Glucocorticoids like Dexamethasone have a number of modes of action. While these drugs are used to reduce inflammation, Dexamethasone can also  induce apoptosis thru initiation of autophagy, activate glucocorticoid receptors in the treatment of uveitic edema, alter gene expression in allergic asthma prevent tachycardia-induced ionic remodeling by reduction of atrial sodium current I(Na), increase gut permeability and suppress inflammation. in addition,  Dexamethasone (Dex) can enhance BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation and can differentially modulated dendritic cell maturation and TREM1 signaling pathways in GM-CSF-treated and M-CSF-treated monocytes. Dexamethasone can be used for pain management",

Contrary to our expectation, we found that GC receptor (GR) expression in immune cells was dispensable for successful therapy of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) with dexamethasone. Instead, GC treatment was compromised in mice expressing a defective GR in the nonhematopoietic compartment or selectively lacking the GR in airway epithelial cells. Further, we found that an intact GR dimerization interface was a prerequisite for the suppression of AAI and airway hyperresponsiveness by GCs. Our observation that the ability of dexamethasone to modulate gene expression in airway epithelial cells coincided with its potency to resolve AAI supports a crucial role for transcriptional regulation by the GR in this cell type.",
