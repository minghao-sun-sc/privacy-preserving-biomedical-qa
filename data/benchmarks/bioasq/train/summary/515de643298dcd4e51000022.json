  "question": "What is the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Probiotics are live, microbial food supplements that benefit the host animal by improving intestinal microbial balance. Across all 11 probiotic species and eight different gastrointestinal diseases   - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Helicobacter pylori infection (HPP), Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), Pouchitis (Pouch), Antibiotic Associated diarrhea (AAD), Clostridium difficile Disease (CDD), Infectious diarrhea (ID), and Travellers diarrhea (TD) -  probiotics have been shown to have effect on prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disease through enhancing the immune response, protection against abnormal invasive bacteria. Probiotics have a role in all age groups, incl. infants.",

The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics.",

However, they do share several common features in that they exert anti-inflammatory effects, they employ different strategies to antagonize competing microorganisms, and they induce cytoprotective changes in the host either through enhancement of barrier function, or through the upregulation of cytoprotective host proteins.",
