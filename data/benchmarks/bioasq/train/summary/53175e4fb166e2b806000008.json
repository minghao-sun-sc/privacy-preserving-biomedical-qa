Expression of the mouse Per (mPer) genes have diurnal pattern in the suprachiamstic nuclei and in peripheral tissues. Genetic ablation mPER1 and mPER2 function results in a complete loss of circadian rhythm control based on wheel running activity in mice. In addition, these animals also display apparent premature aging and significant increase in neoplastic and hyperplastic phenotypes.",
