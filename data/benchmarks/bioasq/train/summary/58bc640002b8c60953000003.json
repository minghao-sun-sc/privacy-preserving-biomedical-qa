  "question": "What is the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery?",
  "ideal_answer": "Clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins is central to cell survival. UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act.",
