  "question": "What is ProSavin?",
  "ideal_answer": "ProSavin, a lentiviral vector based gene therapy aimed at restoring local and continuous dopamine production in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. It has been shown to be well tolerated in a Phase I/II first-in-human study, with significant improvements in motor behavior from baseline at 1 year. Moderate improvements in motor behavior over baseline continued to be reported in the majority of patients who could still be evaluated up to 5 years of follow-up.",
