  "question": "What is the function of the Mis18 protein?",
  "ideal_answer": "Kinetochores assemble on a specialized chromosomal locus termed the centromere, which is characterized by the replacement of histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes with the essential histone H3 variant CENP-A (centromere protein A). The Mis18 complex has been identified as a critical factor for the centromeric localization of a histone H3 variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A), which is responsible for the specification of centromere identity in the chromosome. Further, we demonstrate Mis18\u00ce\u00b1's crucial role for epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin by reinforcing centromeric localization of DNMT3A/3B. Mis18\u00ce\u00b1 interacts with DNMT3A/3B, and this interaction is critical for maintaining DNA methylation and hence regulating epigenetic states of centromeric chromatin. Together, our findings uncover the functional mechanism of Mis18\u00ce\u00b1 and its pivotal role in mammalian cell cycle. The Mis18 complex is a critical player in determining when and where centromeres are built.",
