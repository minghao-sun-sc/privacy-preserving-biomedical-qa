  "question": "What is the principle of ATAC (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) technique?",
  "ideal_answer": "ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) is an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin. ATAC is a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution.",
