  "question": "What is the role of Inn1 in cytokinesis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Inn1 associates with the contractile actomyosin ring at the end of mitosis and is needed for cytokinesis. Inn1 has a C2 domain at the amino terminus of the protein that is required for ingression of the plasma membrane during cytokinesis in budding yeast, whereas the remainder of the protein recruits Inn1 to the actomyosin ring",

We show that phosphorylation of Inn1 by Cdk1 partially perturbs the interaction of Inn1 with Cyk3 thereby reducing the levels of Cyk3 at the cell division site. We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis",
