In addition to steroids, some new medical therapies are being investigated and one of the promising one is Bevacizumab; a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the cases of steroid resistant perilesional edemas, however bevacizumab has a late term effect resolution of symptoms and radiological improvement can be seen as late as more than 1,5 years after its initiation.
