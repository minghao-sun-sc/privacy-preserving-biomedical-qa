  "question": "What are master regulatory genes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcription factors regulating both the identity and patterning of embryonic structures and the development of individual organs are often called master regulatory genes. These genes, as well as other transcription factors, are parts of signaling networks mediating cellular communication, including inductive interactions between nearby tissues. SOX genes are an example of master regulatory genes that control development and are fundamental to the establishment of sex determination in a multitude of organisms. Because a master regulatory gene can regulate the concurrent expression of several genes, its mutation often leads to major diseases. In particular, the master regulatory genes that play a crucial role in the process of organism development may also play a key role in carcinogenesis.",
