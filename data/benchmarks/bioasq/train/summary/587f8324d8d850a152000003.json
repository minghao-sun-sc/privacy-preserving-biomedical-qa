  "ideal_answer": "Ctf4 links DNA replication with sister chromatid cohesion establishment by recruiting the Chl1 helicase to the replisome. The Eco1 acetyltransferase, helped by factors including Ctf4 and Chl1, concomitantly acetylates the chromosomal cohesin complex to stabilize its cohesive links.",

      "text": "The Chl1 helicase facilitates replication fork progression under conditions of nucleotide depletion, partly independently of Ctf4 interaction. Conversely, Ctf4 interaction, but not helicase activity, is required for Chl1's role in sister chromatid cohesion. A physical interaction between Chl1 and the cohesin complex during S phase suggests that Chl1 contacts cohesin to facilitate its acetylation. Our results reveal how Ctf4 forms a replisomal interaction hub that coordinates replication fork progression and sister chromatid cohesion establishment.",
