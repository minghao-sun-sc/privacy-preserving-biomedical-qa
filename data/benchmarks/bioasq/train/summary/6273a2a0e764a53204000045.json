  "question": "What links immune response pathways to ALS?",
  "ideal_answer": "Microglia, which are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are strongly implicated in ALS, their activation being correlated with various clinical features, and inflammatory microglial responses being correlated withe disease progression. The immune response may be implicated in other ways with ALS molecular pathology. such as through inflammatory regulation and circulating interleukins. It is possible the T cell receptor signalling and activation is involved. It is also possible that the innate / non-specific immune system is involved - i.e. immune protection against foreign substances, viruses, and bacteria.",
