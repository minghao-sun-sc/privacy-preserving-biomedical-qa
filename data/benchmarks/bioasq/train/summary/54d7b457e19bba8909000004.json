  "question": "What is the \"Proteomic ruler\"?",
  "ideal_answer": "The MS signal of histones can be used as a \"proteomic ruler\" because it is proportional to the amount of DNA in the sample, which in turn depends on the number of cells. As a result, our proteomic ruler approach adds an absolute scale to the MS readout and allows estimation of the copy numbers of individual proteins per cell.",
