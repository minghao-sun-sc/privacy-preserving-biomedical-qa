  "question": "What is known about aberrant proteolytic activity in disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Research into Alzheimer's disease pathology and treatment has often focused on presenilin proteins. These proteins provide the key catalytic activity of the \u03b3-secretase complex in the cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein and resultant amyloid tangle deposition. Over the last 25 years, screening novel drugs to control this aberrant proteolytic activity has yet to identify effective treatments for the disease.\nOthers are human skin disorders where proteolytic pathways are dysregulated.",
