  "question": "What is foliglurax?",
  "ideal_answer": "Foliglurax is a positive allosteric modulator of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4.  Foliglurax induced a robust and dose-dependent reversal of parkinsonian motor symptoms in macaques, including bradykinesia, tremor, posture, and mobility. Moreover, PXT002331 strongly decreased dyskinesia severity, thus having therapeutic efficacy on both parkinsonian motor impairment and l-dopa-induced dyskinesia. It was the first compound of its class to enter phase IIa clinical trials.",
