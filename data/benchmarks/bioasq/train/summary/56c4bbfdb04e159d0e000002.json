  "question": "What are piggyBAC transposons?",
  "ideal_answer": "The piggyBAC transposons are a nonviral gene delivery approach, that have been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis. It  can mobilize 100-kb DNA fragments in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, making it the only known transposon with such a large cargo capacity. The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo. Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint. The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications.",
