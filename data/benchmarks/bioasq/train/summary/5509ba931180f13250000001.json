  "question": "What is the treatment of choice  for gastric lymphoma?",
  "ideal_answer": "The treatment of choice for localized primary GI lymphoma is controversial. Complete surgical resection may increase the chance of complete remission, but mortality and relapse rates might be higher than those observed with combination chemotherapy alone.\nIn early stages of disease, H. pylori eradication alone may lead to complete lymphoma remission in up to 75% of cases. Nonresponder or locally advanced lymphoma should be treated with radiation therapy.",
