  "question": "Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome",
  "ideal_answer": "Iron deficiency (low serum ferritin) is a recognized cause for RLS. Further, in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome, the dopamine transporter is decreased, which leads to impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission. There is also a report of magnesium deficiency underlying RLS.",

However, they did not consider the routine abnormal, as it had been their habitual behavior since infancy. Some parents were too distressed or embarrassed to describe the symptoms of their child properly. Five patients had clear family history and none had obvious periodic leg movements during sleep. All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases.",
