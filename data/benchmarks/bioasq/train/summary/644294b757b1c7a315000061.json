  "ideal_answer": "Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) can aggregate and form toxic oligomers and insoluble fibrils which are the main component of Lewy bodies. Intra-neuronal Lewy bodies are a major pathological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). Injection of preformed a-syn fibrils (PFF) into the rodent brain can induce aggregation of the endogenous monomeric a-syn resulting in neuronal dysfunction and eventual cell death",
