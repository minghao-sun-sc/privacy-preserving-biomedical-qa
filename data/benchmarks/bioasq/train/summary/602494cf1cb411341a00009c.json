  "ideal_answer": "Givosiran is an aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1)-directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a ligand to enable specific delivery of the siRNA to hepatocytes. This results in downregulation of ALAS1 mRNA and prevents accumulation of neurotoxic \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen levels that are associated with acute porphyria attacks.",
