  "question": "What is Etizolam?",
  "ideal_answer": "Etizolam is a benzodiazepine analogue that is approved for use in Japan, Italy and India as an anxiolytic drug with a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the classic benzodiazepines. Neurochemical research suggests that etizolam may have selectivity for the subpopulation of Y-aminobutyric acid type A receptors associated with anxiety (ie, alpha1, beta2, gamma2).",
