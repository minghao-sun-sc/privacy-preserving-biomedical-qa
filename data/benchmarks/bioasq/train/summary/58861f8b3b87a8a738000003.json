  "question": "What is the purpose of the Orpington Prognostic Scale?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS) is used to predict futue functional status of stroke patients, to asses stroke severity, outcome and response to subacute rehabilitation. In patients with stroke, OPS and NIHSS had significant contribution to the estimation of the functional status and OPS was more effective than NIHSS. However, other reported that the OPS has limited predictive accuracy for discharge destination and is a poor predictor of follow-up services.",
