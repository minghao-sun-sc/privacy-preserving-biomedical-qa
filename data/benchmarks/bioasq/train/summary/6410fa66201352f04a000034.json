  "question": "How does CYP1A2 relate to coffee consumption and apetite?",
  "ideal_answer": "CYP1A2 rs762551 polymorphism modifies the association of habitual coffee consumption with BMI, in part by influencing appetite, energy intake and circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone asprosin. In specific, high coffee consumption was more prevalent in rapid compared to slow metabolizers (P\u2009=\u20090.008 after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI) and was associated with lower appetite perception and lower BMI only in rapid metabolizers (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption\u2009=\u20090.002 and 0.048, respectively)",

This differential association of rs762551 genotype and coffee consumption with BMI was more evident in individuals at higher genetic risk of obesity (mean adjusted difference in BMI\u2009=\u2009-5.82\u2009kg/m2 for rapid versus slow/intermediate metabolizers who consumed more than 14 cups of coffee per week).",
