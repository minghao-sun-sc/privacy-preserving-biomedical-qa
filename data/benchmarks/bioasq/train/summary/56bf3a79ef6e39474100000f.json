  "question": "What is the association of estrogen replacement therapy and intracranial meningioma risk?",
  "ideal_answer": "The association between hormone replacement therapy and meningioma risk is controversial. Increased risk of meningioma was demonstrated in estrogen-only hormonal replacement therapy. However, other studies did not find an association between hormonal replacement therapy and meningioma risk.",
