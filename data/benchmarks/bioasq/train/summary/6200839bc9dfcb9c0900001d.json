However, during the delayed phase, a higher Apfel score was the strongest predictor. In the early and delayed phases, long anesthesia duration was associated with high risk of PONV. Thus, prolonged anesthesia and desflurane use should be avoided for patients at high risk of PONV, particularly those with high Apfel scores.",
