  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of Romosozumab?",
  "ideal_answer": "Romosozumab is humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin. It inhibits sclerostin, thereby increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. This dual effect of romosozumab leads to rapid and substantial increases in areal bone mineral density as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. It is developed for osteoporosis treatment.",
