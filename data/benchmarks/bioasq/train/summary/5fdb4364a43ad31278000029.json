  "question": "Which is the role of the IFIT1 gene in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?",
  "ideal_answer": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is caused by a protein called interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1). IFIT1 is the first gene described as a candidate gene for SLE, and may function activating Rho proteins through interaction with Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RHG).",
