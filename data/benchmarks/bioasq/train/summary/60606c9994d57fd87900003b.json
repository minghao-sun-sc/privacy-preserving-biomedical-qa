CrossICC utilizes an iterative strategy to derive the optimal gene signature and cluster numbers from a consensus similarity matrix generated by consensus clustering. This package also provides abundant functions to visualize the identified subtypes and evaluate subtyping performance. We expected that CrossICC could be used to discover the robust cancer subtypes with significant translational implications in personalized care for cancer patients.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package is implemented in R and available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinformatist/CrossICC) and Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CrossICC.html) under the GPL v3 License.",
