  "question": "What is the genomic structure of the FAA (FANCA) gene?",
  "ideal_answer": "The FAA (FANCA) gene contains 43 exons spanning approximately 80 kb. Exons range from 34 to 188 bp, whereas sequence analysis of the 5' region upstream of the putative transcription start site showed no obvious TATA and CAAT boxes, but did show a GC-rich region, typical of housekeeping genes.",

      "text": "In the present study we describe the genomic structure of the FAA gene. The gene contains 43 exons spanning approximately 80 kb as determined by the alignment of four cosmids and the fine localization of the first and the last exons in restriction fragments of these clones. Exons range from 34 to 188 bp",
