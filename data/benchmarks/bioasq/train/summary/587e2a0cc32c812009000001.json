  "question": "What is Path2PPI?",
  "ideal_answer": "Path2PPI is an R package to identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for fully sequenced organisms for which nearly none PPI are known. Path2PPI predicts PPI networks based on sets of proteins from well-established model organisms, providing an intuitive visualization and usability. It can be used to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway or biological process from several reference organisms to one target organism.",
