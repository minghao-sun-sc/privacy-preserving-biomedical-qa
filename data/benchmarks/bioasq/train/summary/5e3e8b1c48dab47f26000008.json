  "question": "What are the effects of 14-3-3 dimers on Tau phosphorylation?",
  "ideal_answer": "14-3-3 dimers regulate steady-state phosphorylation of both wild-type and the R406W mutant Tau, but they are not essential for toxicity of either variant. Furthermore, recruitment of dimers on accumulating wild- type Tau increases its steady- state levels ostensibly by occluding access to proteases in a phosphorylated-dependent manner.",

      "text": "Proteomic, biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate that both Drosophila 14-3-3 proteins interact with human wild-type and mutant Tau on multiple sites irrespective of their phosphorylation state. 14-3-3 dimers regulate steady-state phosphorylation of both wild-type and the R406W mutant Tau, but they are not essential for toxicity of either variant. Moreover, 14-3-3 elevation itself is not pathogenic, but recruitment of dimers on accumulating wild-type Tau increases its steady-state levels ostensibly by occluding access to proteases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contrast, the R406W mutant, which lacks a putative 14-3-3 binding site, responds differentially to elevation of each 14-3-3 isoform. Although excess 14-3-3\u03b6 stabilizes the mutant protein, elevated D14-3-3\u025b has a destabilizing effect probably because of altered 14-3-3 dimer composition.",
