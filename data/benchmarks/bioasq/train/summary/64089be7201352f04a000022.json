  "question": "Please summarize the difference between REMS and RMPs",
  "ideal_answer": "Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are FDA-mandated programs that require drug manufacturers to develop and implement plans to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Risk Management Plans (RMPs) are similar to REMS, but are used in the European Union and are focused on the safety of the patient. RMPs are designed to identify, characterize, and prevent or minimize risks associated with a drug.",

      "text": "Both REMS and RMPs provide positive guidance for identification, monitoring, and minimization of risk to patient safety. Currently, neither agency provides specific guidance on how risk should be related to benefit either qualitatively or quantitatively.",
