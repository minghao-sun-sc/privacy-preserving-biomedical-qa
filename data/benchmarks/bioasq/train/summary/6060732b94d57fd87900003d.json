  "ideal_answer": "ReactiveomeGSA is a novel resource for comparative pathway analyses of multi-omics datasets. Data from different species is automatically mapped to a common pathway space. Public data from ExpressionAt Atlas and Single Cell ExpressionAtlas can be directly integrated in the analysis. reactomegSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-CSF, cross-species, and Comparative Pathways analysis.",

ReactomeGSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-omics, cross-species, comparative pathway analyses.We used ReactomeGSA to characterize the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity. We compared B cell rich and poor human cancer samples from five of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomics and two of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteomics studies. B cell-rich lung adenocarcinoma samples lacked the otherwise present activation through NFkappaB. This may be linked to the presence of a specific subset of tumor associated IgG+ plasma cells that lack NFkappaB activation in scRNA-seq data from human melanoma. This showcases how ReactomeGSA can derive novel biomedical insights by integrating large multi-omics datasets.",
