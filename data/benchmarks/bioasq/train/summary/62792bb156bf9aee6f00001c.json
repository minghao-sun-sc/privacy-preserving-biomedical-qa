  "question": "What is \"long-COVID\"?",
  "ideal_answer": "\"Long-COVID\" is a complex condition where the affected individuals do not recover for several weeks or months following the onset of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and the symptoms are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.\n\nPersistent physical symptoms following acute COVID-19 are common and typically include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough. Headache, joint pain, myalgias, and loss of smell have also been reported. Common psychological and cognitive symptoms include poor concentration, cognitive impairment/confusion, insomnia, and overall reduced quality of life.",
