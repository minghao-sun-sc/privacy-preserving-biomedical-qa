  "question": "What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with gastric cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma. 2D:4D was found to be higher in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and prostate cancer  patients relative to controls. Among prostate cancer patients, 2D:4D shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, other authors did not find an association between 2D:4D  and prostate cancer risk.\n 2D:4D is not associated with testicular germ cell tumors.",
