  "question": "Describe the function of a transcription factor such as SOX10.",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA sequences to regulate gene transcription. They serve as integration centers of the different signal-transduction pathways affecting a given gene. It is obvious that the regulation of these regulators themselves is of crucial importance for differential gene expression during development and in terminally differentiated cells. In particular, the transcription factor SOX10 plays an important role in vertebrate neural crest development, including the establishment and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage.",
