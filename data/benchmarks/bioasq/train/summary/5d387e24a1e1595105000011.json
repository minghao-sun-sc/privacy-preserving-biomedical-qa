  "question": "What is particular about the mouse Fxy gene's chromosomal position?",
  "ideal_answer": "We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes. The Fxy gene in mice is also located on the X chromosome but spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in this species.",
