  "question": "How is spastic diplegia diagnosed?",
  "ideal_answer": "Diagnosis of spastic diplegia is mainly carried out with through clinical gait analysis (CGA), with variations such as 1-minute walk, LSU, and 10-meter walk tests, or Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88). Other methods used for evaluation of patients include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and motor function, presence of epileptic episodes, and IQ or developmental quotient.",
