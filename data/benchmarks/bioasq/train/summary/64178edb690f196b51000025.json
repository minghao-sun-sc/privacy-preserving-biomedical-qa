Casimersen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer designed to bypass frameshift DMD mutations and produce internally truncated, yet functional, dystrophin protein in patients amenable to exon 45 skipping. Our primary study objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of casimersen; the secondary objective was to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics.ME",
