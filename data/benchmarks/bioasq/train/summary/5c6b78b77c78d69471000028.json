  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of cemiplimab?",
  "ideal_answer": "Cemiplimab is human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with programmed death ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2). It is approved to treat patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for surgery or radiation.",
