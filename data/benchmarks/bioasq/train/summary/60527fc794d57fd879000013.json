  "ideal_answer": "Fingolimod has been shown to reduce/prevent both focal and diffuse grey matter (GM) damage in active multiple sclerosis. The percentage of patients with new cortical lesions (CL) (13.5 vs. 89%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the percentage of GM volume change was lower in the fingolimod treated group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The regional analysis revealed that the treated group had also less volume loss in thalamus, caudatus, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus (p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as in, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, and insular-long gyrus (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
