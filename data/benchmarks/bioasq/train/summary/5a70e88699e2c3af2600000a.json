  "question": "Describe mechanism of action of Nusinersen.",
  "ideal_answer": "Nusinersen is a modified antisense oligonucleotide that binds to a specific sequence in the intron, downstream of exon 7 on the pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) of the SMN2 gene. This modulates the splicing of the SMN2 mRNA transcript to include exon 7, thereby increasing the production of full-length SMN protein. It is approved for treatment of  spinal muscular atrophy.",
