  "question": "What is the association between adiponectin and migraine?",
  "ideal_answer": "There is evidence to suggest that adiponectin plays a role in migraine. Increase in body fat elevates adiponectin and leptin secretion which in turn impair inflammatory processes that could be contributing to migraine risk. In episodic migraine patients, adiponectin was associated with migraine severity and predictive of acute treatment response. Serum adiponectin levels are increased in women chronic daily headache sufferers.",
