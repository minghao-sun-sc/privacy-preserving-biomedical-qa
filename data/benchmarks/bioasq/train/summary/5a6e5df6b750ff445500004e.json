  "ideal_answer": "GARLIC (GWAS-based Prediction Toolkit for Connecting Diseases and Cell Types) is a bioinformatic toolkit for aetiologically connecting diseases and cell type-specific regulatory maps. GARLIC can be used to retrieve potential disease-causative genetic variants overlapping regulatory sequences of interest. Overall, GARLIC can satisfy several important needs within the field of medical genetics, thus potentially assisting in the ultimate goal of uncovering the elusive and complex genetic basis of common human disorders.",
