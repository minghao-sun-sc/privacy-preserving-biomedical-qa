  "ideal_answer": "Subcutaneous administrations of SAR425899 were tested in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials. In the first trial, healthy overweight volunteers (body mass index [BMI] 25-30\u2009kg/m2 ; n\u2009=\u200932) received single-ascending doses (0.01-0.1 mg) of SAR425899 or placebo. In the second, a multiple-ascending-dose trial (NCT02411825), healthy normal- to overweight volunteers (BMI 20-30\u2009kg/m2 ; n\u2009=\u200940) and overweight/obese patients with T2D (BMI 28-42\u2009kg/m2 ; n\u2009=\u200936) received daily doses of SAR425899 or placebo over 21 or 28\u2009days, respectively.",
