  "question": "What are the molecular and cellular effects of LB-100 on ovarian carcinoma cells following cisplatin treatment?",
  "ideal_answer": "LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and gH2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites.",
