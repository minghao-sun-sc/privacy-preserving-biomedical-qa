  "question": "What is Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) used to determine?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is an objective anatomically-based injury severity scoring system that classifies each injury by body region on a 6 point scale. AIS is the system used to determine the Injury Severity Score (ISS) of the multiply injured trauma patient.\n\nAIS CLASSIFICATIONS\nThe AIS classifies individual injuries by body region as follows:\nAIS 1 \u2013 Minor\nAIS 2 \u2013 Moderate\nAIS 3 \u2013 Serious\nAIS 4 \u2013 Severe\nAIS 5 \u2013 Critical\nAIS 6 \u2013 Maximal (currently untreatable)",
