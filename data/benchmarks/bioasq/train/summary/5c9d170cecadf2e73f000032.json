  "question": "What conditions are associated with mutations in the gene FAAH?",
  "ideal_answer": "Human FAAH gene mutations are associated with increased body weight and obesity. Results suggest that genetic mutations in FAAH may constitute important risk factors for problem drug use and support a potential link between functional abnormalities in the endogenous cannabinoid system and drug abuse and dependence.\nresearch on the genetic modulation of pain has already identified variants in these genes, relative to pain, which may facilitate the pharmacogenetic assessments of new analgesics.",
