  "question": "What is the difference in the roles of Tcf1 and Tcf3 during development?",
  "ideal_answer": "\u03a4here are opposing effects of Tcf3 and Tcf1 in the control of Wnt stimulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal. In contrast to \u03b2-catenin-dependent functions described for Tcf1 the known embryonic functions for Tcf3 are consistent with \u03b2-catenin-independent repressor activity. Wnt signal stimulation reduces the level of Tcf3, and increases those of Tcf1 (also known as Tcf7) and Lef1, positive mediators of Wnt signaling.",
