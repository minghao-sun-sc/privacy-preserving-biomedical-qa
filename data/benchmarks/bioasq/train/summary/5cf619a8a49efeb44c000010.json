  "question": "What is the function of the Spt6 gene in yeast?",
  "ideal_answer": "Spt6 is a highly conserved histone chaperone that interacts directly with both RNA polymerase II and histones to regulate gene expression. Spt6 is a highly conserved factor required for normal transcription and chromatin structure. Binding of elongation factor Spt6 to Iws1 provides an effective means for coupling eukaryotic mRNA synthesis, chromatin remodelling and mRNA export. Spt6 Is Essential for rRNA Synthesis by RNA Polymerase I. Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression.",
