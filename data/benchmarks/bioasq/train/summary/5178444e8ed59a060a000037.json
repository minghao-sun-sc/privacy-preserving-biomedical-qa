  "question": "What is the main mechanism by which human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7 contribute to cell transformation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Although they may have other targets, human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7 interact with and block the function of p53 and pRb, respectively, therefore deregulating cell cycle and leading to cellular transformation.",
