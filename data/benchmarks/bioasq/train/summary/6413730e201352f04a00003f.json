  "question": "Please summarize the function of Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP)",
  "ideal_answer": "TROAP is a cytoplasmic protein that is required for spindle assembly and cell invasion. Its role in cancer is not yet fully understood, but it has been shown to regulate cell cycle and promote tumor progression through Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway in glioma cells.",
