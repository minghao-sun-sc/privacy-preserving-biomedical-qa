  "question": "What is known about maternal smoking and brain tumor risk?",
  "ideal_answer": "Findings regarding association of maternal smoking and brain tumor risk are mixed. It was shown that children of women who smoked during pregnancy had an increased incidence of brain tumors (hazard ratio = 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.53). The increase in risk was similar for benign and malignant tumors, and was most apparent for astrocytoma. However, other authors did not find association between maternal smoking and brain tumor risk.",
