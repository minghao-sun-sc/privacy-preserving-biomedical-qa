  "ideal_answer": "CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of transcription. It is a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which is essential for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and the subsequent transcriptional elongation.",
