  "question": "What is known about the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring?",
  "ideal_answer": "Greater risk for autism spectrum disorders has been reported among mothers that have used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. However, others did not find an association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring. Also, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy were associated with a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with autism spectrum disorders.",

Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively.",

      "text": "Among the potential environmental factors, hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues, hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs, and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy. ",
