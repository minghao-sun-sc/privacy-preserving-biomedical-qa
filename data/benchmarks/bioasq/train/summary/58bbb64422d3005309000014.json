  "ideal_answer": "Modified nucleotides in messenger RNA (mRNA) have been discovered over 40 years ago, but until recently little was known about which transcripts contain them and what their function is. High-throughput sequencing approaches revealed a dynamic landscape of the 'Epitranscriptome' for many mRNA modifications in various organisms from yeast to humans.\t\t\nThe detection methods of RNA modifications has enabled investigation of a new layer of gene regulation - the epitranscriptome.",
