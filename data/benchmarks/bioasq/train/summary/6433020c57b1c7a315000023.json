  "ideal_answer": "Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) (Ruconest(\u00ae), Pharming) is a new drug developed for the relief of symptoms occurring in patients with angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. the therapeutic efficacy of rhC1INH results from its ability to block the actions of enzymes belonging to the overactivated bradykinin-forming pathway, at multiple locations. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this agent in all localizations of hereditary angioedema attacks.",
