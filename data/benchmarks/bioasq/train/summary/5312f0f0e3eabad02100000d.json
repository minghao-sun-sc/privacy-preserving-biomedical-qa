  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors?",
  "ideal_answer": "DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors eliminate cancer cells by causing DNA double-strand breaks, finally leading to apoptotic cell death. Moreover, drug-induced histone eviction was also shown to be associated with attenuated DNA repair, epigenetic changes and transcpription deregulation.",
