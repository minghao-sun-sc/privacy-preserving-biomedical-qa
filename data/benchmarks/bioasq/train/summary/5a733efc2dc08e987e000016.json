It is associated with pain (n\u00a0=\u00a07/12, 58.\u00a0%), edema (n\u00a0=\u00a07/12, 58\u00a0%), and paresthesia (n\u00a0=\u00a03/12, 25\u00a0%). The median time to resolution of symptoms without any intervention was 4\u00a0days (range 2-14).CONCLUSION: AS is self-limiting and a non-urgent surgical condition. It can be differentiated from other pathologies by clinical spectrum, patient demographics and in doubtful circumstances (acute limb ischemia) by Doppler sonography. ",
