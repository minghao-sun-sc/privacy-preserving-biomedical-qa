  "question": "Describe the mechanism of action of the LINX system for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.",
  "ideal_answer": "LINX Reflux Management System is a sphincter augmentation device designed to prevent gastroesophageal reflux due to abnormal opening of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) by augmenting the sphincter barrier. It is implanted via laparoscopic procedure that does not alter gastric anatomy and is easily reversible.",
