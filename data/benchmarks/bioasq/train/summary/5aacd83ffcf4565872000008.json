  "question": "What is PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance?",
  "ideal_answer": "PARPi has been designed and tested for many years and became a potential supplement for the conventional chemotherapy. However, increasing evidence indicates the appearance of the resistance to this treatment. Specifically, cancer cells may acquire new mutations or events that overcome the positive effect of these drugs.",

      "text": "Recent studies have shown that PARP-1 could be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive in different cancers. PARP inhibitor resistance is also a growing concern in the clinical setting. Recently, changes in the levels of PARP-1 activity or expression in cancer patients have provided the basis for consideration of PARP-1 regulatory proteins as potential biomarkers. ",
