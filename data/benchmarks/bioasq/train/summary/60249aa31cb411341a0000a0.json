  "question": "What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?",
  "ideal_answer": "Hemophilic Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia. It  is an encapsulated haematoma in patients with haemophilia  which has a tendency to progress and produce clinical symptoms related to its anatomical location. The lesion most frequently occurs in the long bones, pelvis, small bones of the hands and feet, or rarely in the maxillofacial region.",
