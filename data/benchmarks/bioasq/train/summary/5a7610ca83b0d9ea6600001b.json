  "question": "What is the role of nimotuzumab in treatment of pontine glioma?",
  "ideal_answer": "Nimotuzumab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) is being used for treatment of pontine gliomas. Nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug with acceptable toxicity, and it may have promising value in the combination treatment. Clinical trials evaluating efficacy of nimotuzumab  are ongoing.",
