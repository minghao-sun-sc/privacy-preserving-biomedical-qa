  "ideal_answer": "The Shigella flexneri Invaplex 50 is a macromolecular complex containing IpaB, IpaC, and LPS, formulated from an aqueous extract of virulent Shigella delivered via nasal administration. It is used against shigellosis, a leading cause of diarrhea worldwide. The Invaplex 50 nasal vaccine was safe with encouraging mucosal immune responses.",
