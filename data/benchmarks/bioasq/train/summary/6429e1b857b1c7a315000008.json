  "question": "What is the significance of a persistently positive RT-PCR for weeks after illness?",
  "ideal_answer": "Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 can have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens for weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, prolonged viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate prolonged infectiousness. In particular, isolation of infectious virus more than 10 days after illness onset is rare in patients whose symptoms have resolved.\n\nPeople with COVID-19 are thus generally felt to have low infectiousness after about 10 days, particularly after mild to moderate disease and in the absence of immunocompromise, regardless of whether they continue to have a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.",
