  "ideal_answer": "As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators. As transcriptional coactivator, BRD4 represses autophagy and lysosomal function.",
