  "question": "what is the role of TGFbeta in cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury?",
  "ideal_answer": "TGF\u03b2 is activated in the myocardium in response to injury and plays a crucial role in cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation while promoting myofibroblast phenotypic modulation and extracellular matrix deposition. In fact, upregulation of TGF-beta signaling promotes the formation of a myofibroblast-like phenotype. TGF-beta interacts with bone morphogenic protein and Wnt pathways to form a complex signaling network that is critical in regulating the fate choices of both stromal and tissue-specific resident stem cells, determining whether functional regeneration or the formation of scar tissue follows an injury. In addition, TGF-beta enhances the formation of cardiospheres and could potentially enhance the regenerative potential of adult cardiac progenitor cells.",

These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling pathways. Direct examination of heart regeneration after mechanical or genetic ablation injuries indicated that these pathways are activated in regenerating cardiomyocytes and that they can be pharmacologically manipulated to inhibit or enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation during adult heart regeneration.
