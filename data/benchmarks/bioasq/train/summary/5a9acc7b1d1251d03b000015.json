  "ideal_answer": "Crenezumab is a humanized antibody targeting Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) which is currently tested in multiple clinical trials for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. It strongly reacts with amyloid plaques and detects N-terminally modified A\u03b2 peptides A\u03b24-42 and pyroglutamate A\u03b23-42.",
