  "question": "What is the role of edaravone in traumatic brain injury?",
  "ideal_answer": "Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury. In animal models, edaravone has been shown to reduce neuronal damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintain intact the autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature, decrease neuronal loss, reduce programmed cell death, the presence of inflammatory cytokines, cerebral edema, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Edaravone also protects against neurological deficits and memory deficits following traumatic brain injury.",
