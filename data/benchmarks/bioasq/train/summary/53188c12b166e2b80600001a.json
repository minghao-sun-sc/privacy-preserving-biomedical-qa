  "question": "What is the role of RhoA in bladder cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "In urinary bladder cancer, RhoA was more commonly found to be activated in the later stages of the disease. This activation was related to poor tumor differentiation, muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, and shortened disease-free and overall survival.",
