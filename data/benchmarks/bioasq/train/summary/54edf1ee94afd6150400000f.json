      "text": "Here we report the isolation of a cDNA representing the FAA gene, following an expression cloning method similar to the one used to clone the FAC gene. The 5.5-kb cDNA has an open reading frame of 4,368 nucleotides. In contrast to the 63-kD cytosolic protein encoded by the FAC gene, the predicted FAA protein (M(r) 162, 752) contains two overlapping bipartite nuclear localization signals and a partial leucine zipper consensus, which are suggestive of a nuclear localization",
