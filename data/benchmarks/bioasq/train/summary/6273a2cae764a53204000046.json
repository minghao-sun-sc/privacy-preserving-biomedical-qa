  "question": "What links developmental pathways to ALS?",
  "ideal_answer": "A direct link between developmental pathways and ALS is not described. However, cytoskeletal proteins such as KIF5A are implicated in ALS, and the cytoskeletal protein N-cadherin is involved in plasticity of the cerebral cortex. Development depends on connections of the sympathetic nervous system, involving mechanisms such as axon growth, neuron survival, and dendrite growth. BACE1, which is involved in Alzheimer's disease, is also implicated in axonal regeneration.",
