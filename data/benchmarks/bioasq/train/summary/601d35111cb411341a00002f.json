  "ideal_answer": "KIF1A-related disorders (KRD) were first described in 2011 and the phenotypic spectrum has subsequently expanded to encompass a range of central and peripheral nervous system involvement. A study identified twelve individuals from 10 families. Eight different mutations were present, including four novel mutations. Two patients displayed a very severe phenotype including congenital contractures, severe spasticity and/or dystonia, dysautonomia, severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy and optic atrophy, significant white matter changes on brain MRI, respiratory insufficiency, and complete lack of neurodevelopmental progress. The remaining 10 patients represented a spectrum of severity with common features including a movement disorder with spasticity and/or dystonia, subtle features of dysautonomia, sensory axonal neuropathy, varying degrees of optic atrophy and of learning and/or behavioural difficulties, and subtle or absent-but sometimes progressive-changes in white matter on MRI. Epilepsy was common among the more severely affected children.",

      "text": "KIF1A-related disorders (KRD) were first described in 2011 and the phenotypic spectrum has subsequently expanded to encompass a range of central and peripheral nervous system involvement. Here we present a case series demonstrating the range of clinical, neurophysiological, and radiological features which may occur in childhood-onset KRD. We report on all the children and young people seen at a single large tertiary centre. Data were collected through a retrospective case-notes review. Twelve individuals from 10 families were identified. Eight different mutations were present, including four novel mutations. Two patients displayed a very severe phenotype including congenital contractures, severe spasticity and/or dystonia, dysautonomia, severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy and optic atrophy, significant white matter changes on brain MRI, respiratory insufficiency, and complete lack of neurodevelopmental progress. The remaining 10 patients represented a spectrum of severity with common features including a movement disorder with spasticity and/or dystonia, subtle features of dysautonomia, sensory axonal neuropathy, varying degrees of optic atrophy and of learning and/or behavioural difficulties, and subtle or absent-but sometimes progressive-changes in white matter on MRI. Epilepsy was common among the more severely affected children. This case series demonstrates that KRD comprise a range of neurological disorders, with both the milder and the more severe forms combining central and peripheral (including autonomic) nervous system deficits.",
