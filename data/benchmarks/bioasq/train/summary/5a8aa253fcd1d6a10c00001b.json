  "question": "Which is the specificity of deubiquitinase USP25?",
  "ideal_answer": "Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation. It specially catalyzes the hydrolysis of the K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains.",
