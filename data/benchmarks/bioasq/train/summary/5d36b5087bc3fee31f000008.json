  "question": "What is the function of the PDZ domain in SATB1?",
  "ideal_answer": "N-terminal PDZ-like domain of chromatin organizer SATB1 contributes towards its function as transcription regulator. We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions. These studies clearly demonstrated the role of PDZ domain of SATB1 in global gene regulation presumably through its interaction with other cellular proteins. PDZ domain-mediated dimerization and homeodomain-directed specificity are required for high-affinity DNA binding by SATB1.",
