  "question": "What is the correlation between SPARC expression and growth inhibition in human cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a multi-faceted protein-modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. SPARC seems to act as a tumour suppressor, as it has been found that loss of SPARC accelerates the development of certain types of cancer, whereas its expression impairs tumor growth. However it has also been associated with a aggressive phenotypes of some tumours. The role of SPARC may depend on its subcellular localization.",

SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation",
