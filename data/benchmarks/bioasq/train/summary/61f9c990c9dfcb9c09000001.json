      "text": "As computational modeling becomes more essential to analyze and understand biological regulatory mechanisms, governance of the many databases and knowledge bases that support this domain is crucial to guarantee reliability and interoperability of resources. To address this, the COST Action Gene Regulation Ensemble Effort for the Knowledge Commons (GREEKC, CA15205, www.greekc.org) organized nine workshops in a four-year period, starting September 2016. The workshops brought together a wide range of experts from all over the world working on various steps in the knowledge management process that focuses on understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. The discussions between ontologists, curators, text miners, biologists, bioinformaticians, philosophers and computational scientists spawned a host of activities aimed to standardize and update existing knowledge management workflows and involve end-users in the process of designing the Gene Regulation Knowledge Commons (GRKC). Here the GREEKC consortium describes its main achievements in improving this GRKC.",
