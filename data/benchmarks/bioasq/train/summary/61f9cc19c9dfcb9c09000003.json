  "ideal_answer": "SPar-K is a method to search for archetypical chromatin architectures by partitioning a set of genomic regions characterized by chromatin signal profiles around ChIP-seq peaks and other kinds of functional sites. This method efficiently deals with problems of data heterogeneity, limited misalignment of anchor points and unknown orientation of asymmetric patterns.",
