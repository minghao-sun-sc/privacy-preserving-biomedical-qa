  "question": "What is PWMScan?",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to specific short DNA sequences of 5-20 bp to regulate the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. PWMScan is a fast web-based tool to scan server-resident genomes for matches to a user-supplied PWM or transcription factor binding site model from a public database.",
