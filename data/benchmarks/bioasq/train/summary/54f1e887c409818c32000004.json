  "question": "What is known about thalidomide therapy and survival of glioblastoma patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "Findings regarding clinical value of thalidomide in terms of survival in patients with glioblastoma remain mixed. It has been shown that thalidomide can improve survival of recurrent glioblastoma patients. However, other authors have not confirmed these findings. Furthermore, thalidomide did not improve survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and pediatric glioblastoma patients.",
