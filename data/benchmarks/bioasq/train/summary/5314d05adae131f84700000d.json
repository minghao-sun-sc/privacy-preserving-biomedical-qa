  "question": "What is the role of brain natriuretic peptide in traumatic brain injury patients ?",
  "ideal_answer": "Brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are elevated in patients with traumatic brain during the acute phase and correlate with poor outcomes. In traumatic brain injury patients higher brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are associated with more extensive SAH,  elevated ICP and hyponatremia. Brain natriuretic peptide may play an adaptive role in recovery through augmentation of cerebral blood flow.",

      "text": "This study provides evidence that BNP plasma concentrations increase rapidly after TBI. Plasma BNP concentrations are correlated with hyponatremia in severe TBI patients but not in mild and moderate TBI patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated ICP have a higher serum BNP level in first 4 days after injury.",

      "text": "In average, the peak of BNP level was measured at 703.9 pg/mL\u00b1179.1 pg/mL on day 3 after injury, which was correlated to the severity of TBI. Among patients with severe TBI, plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with hyponatremia were statistically higher than those without hyponatremia (p<0.05). In the hyponatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP increased to a peak of 1001.16 pg/mL\u00b1131.52 pg/mL within 48 hours after injury and maintained at a high level for 3 days. In the normonatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP reached a peak of 826.43 pg/mL\u00b1337.43 pg/mL on day 5 and quickly decreased thereafter. In addition, we found plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with ICP>15 mm Hg were significantly higher than those in patients with ICP\u226415 mm Hg (p<0.01). ",
