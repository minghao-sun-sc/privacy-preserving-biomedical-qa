  "question": "Which is the most well-accepted method for Down syndrome non-invasive prenatal diagnosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Currently, two applications for NIPD of Down syndrome have been developed with potential and have displayed positive results; the NIPD using next-generation sequencing technologies and the NIPD using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This study examined the methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A between maternal and placental DNA, and the implication of this difference in the identification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and in prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Diagnosis of trisomy 21 was established according to the ratio of fetal-specific AIRE to RASSF1A in maternal plasma. Both methods confirmed that AIRE and RASSF1A were hypomethylated in maternal blood cells but hypermethylated in placental or chorionic villus tissues. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21.",
