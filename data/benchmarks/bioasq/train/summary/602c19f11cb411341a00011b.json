  "question": "What is EPICCURE?",
  "ideal_answer": "EPICCURE is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety of AZD8601 in patients with moderately decreased left ventricular function (ejection fraction 30%-50%) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. EPICCURE combines high-efficiency delivery with quantitative targeting and follow-up for robust assessment of the safety and exploratory efficacy of VEGF-A mRNA angiogenesis (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370887).",
