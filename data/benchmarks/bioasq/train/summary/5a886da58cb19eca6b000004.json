  "question": "Has Cas9 gene editing the potential to correct inhereted hearing loss?",
  "ideal_answer": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear in vivo.\r\nThe genetic correction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induced from somatic cells of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (caused by hereditary factors) is a promising method for its treatment. The correction of gene mutations in iPSCs could restore the normal function of cells and provide a rich source of cells for transplantation.",
