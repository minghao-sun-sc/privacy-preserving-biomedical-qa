  "question": "What is the function of yeast TERRA RNAs?",
  "ideal_answer": "The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are transcribed into different species of non-coding transcripts (the telomeric transcriptome), including TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) molecules. TERRA are part of the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional telomeres.  In addition to its role as a template-encoding telomeric DNA synthesis, telomerase RNA has been shown to function as a flexible scaffold for protein subunits of the RNP holoenzyme.",
