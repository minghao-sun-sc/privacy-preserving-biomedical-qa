  "question": "What is a \"cytokine storm\"?",
  "ideal_answer": "During infectious processes, the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), gamma interferon (IFNg) and chemokines orchestrates the anti-infectious innate immune response. However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome.",
