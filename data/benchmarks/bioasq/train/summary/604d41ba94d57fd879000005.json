  "question": "What is the function of kisspeptin in the brain?",
  "ideal_answer": "Kisspeptin is a neuropeptide that plays an integral role in the regulation of energy intake and reproduction by acting centrally on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is the most potent factor known to induce GnRH release. Kisspeptin preserves mitochondrial function by inducing mitophagy and autophagy in aging rat brain hippocampus",
