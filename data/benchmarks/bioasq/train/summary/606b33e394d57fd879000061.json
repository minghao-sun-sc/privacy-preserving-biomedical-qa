  "question": "What is known about growth arrest-specific 6 protein?",
  "ideal_answer": "Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein secreted by immune cells, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes. Recent studies indicate that Gas6 and receptors of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family may be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance.",
