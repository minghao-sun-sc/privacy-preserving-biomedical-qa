  "question": "The secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFPR3) is altered in human cancers.\nAre its level found to increase or to decrease?",
  "ideal_answer": "SFRPs are down-regulated in several cancers and this is often correlated with poor prognosis, as has been shown for breast, colorectal, and a number of other cancers. (PMID: 21494614) We performed tissue microarray and found that the level of sFRP3 protein was high in normal kidney, low in primary renal cancer tissues, and high in metastatic renal cancer tissues.
