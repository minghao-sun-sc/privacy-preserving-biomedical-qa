  "question": "What are the SINEUPs?",
  "ideal_answer": "SINEUPs represent a new class of natural and synthetic antisense long non-coding RNAs that activate translation. These molecules have been named SINEUPs since their function requires the activity of an embedded inverted SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation. Natural SINEUPs suggest that embedded Transposable Elements may represent functional domains in long non-coding RNAs. Synthetic SINEUPs may be designed by targeting the antisense sequence to the mRNA of choice representing the first scalable tool to increase protein synthesis of potentially any gene of interest.",
