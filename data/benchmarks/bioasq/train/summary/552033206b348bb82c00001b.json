  "question": "What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?",
  "ideal_answer": "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. TTX is originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria. TTX is found in warm waters, especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. TTX poisoning due to marine snails has recently spread through Japan, China, Taiwan, and Europe.",
