  "question": "How does thyroid  hormone  regulate  SR-Ca2+ ATPase  (SERCA) protein in the heart?",
  "ideal_answer": "The thyroid hormone (TH) induced regulation of  SERCA is mediated both by non-genomic and genomic actions.\nGenomic actions are mediated by the binding of T(3) receptors (TRs) to the thyroid response elements in the SERCA promotor and result in increased gene expression. \nThyroid hormone  increases the transcription of  SERCA 2  through three thyroid hormone response elements. \nData show that the regulation of  cardiac SERCA by thyroid hormone is made at the  pretranslational and possibly transcriptional level \nTR\u03b21 is shown to be coupled to the expression of SERCA in the heart\nAn  increase of TR expression in the hypertrophied heart has been show to result in  increased SERCA expression.\nInhibition of TR\u03b11 by dronedarone does not change the expression of SERCA in the heart\nFindings show that  SERCA 2 gene expression  is regulated  by TR  isoform-specific interactions with transcription factor (MEF-2) \nHypothyroidism is accompanied by decreased expression of SERCA in the heart.   T3 increases expression of the cardiac SERCA\nTH treatment can reverse the reduction in the ratio of SERCA to phospholamban expression which is found in postinfarcted hearts\nTH treatment  results in increased expression of SERCA in hearts from banded rats",
