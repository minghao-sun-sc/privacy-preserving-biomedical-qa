  "ideal_answer": "Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in term or late preterm infants. It remains unclear to what degree preterm infants were included in these studies.\nA prospective non-randomised pilot study reported that mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) seems both feasible and safe.",

Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress",
