  "question": "What is 2d 4d ratio in athletes.",
  "ideal_answer": "Lower 2D:4D ratio was reported to be lower in handball players,  kabaddi players, varsity athletes, football players, soccer players and rugby players. Low 2D:4D ratio correlates with better performance and with enhanced sporting prowess, particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and dependent upon slow-twitch muscles.",
