  "question": "What are the effects of ibrutinib on CART cell production?",
  "ideal_answer": "CART cell generation in the presence of ibrutinib resulted in increased cell viability and expansion of CLL patient-derived CART cells. Furthermore, ibrutinib enriched CART cells with less-differentiated na\u00efve-like phenotype and decreased expression of exhaustion markers including PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3. In addition, ibrutinib increased the cytokine release capacity of CLL patient-derived CART cells. In summary, BTK/ITK inhibition with ibrutinib during CART cell culture can improve yield and function of CLL patient-derived CART cell products.",
