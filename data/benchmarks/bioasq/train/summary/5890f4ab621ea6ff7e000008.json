  "question": "What is the role of Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in glioma treatment?",
  "ideal_answer": "Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) is used in treatment of gliomas. LITT can be used effectively for treatment of difficult-to-access high-grade gliomas. More complete coverage of tumor improves progression free survival which can be translated as the extent of resection concept for surgery.",
