  "question": "What is endoplasmic reticulum stress?",
  "ideal_answer": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress,\" an imbalance between protein folding load and capacity leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory and metabolic diseases.\nEndoplasmic reticulum stress is associated with the pathophysiology of various liver diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates the accumulation of abnormal proteins and leads to oxidative stress, cytoplasmic inclusion body formation, and apoptosis in hepatocytes.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) is activated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and/or traumatic injuries. Subsequent restoration of ER homeostasis may contribute to improvement in the functional outcome of these diseases.",
