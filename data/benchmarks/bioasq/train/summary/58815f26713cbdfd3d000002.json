  "question": "What is the role of the Ctf4-interacting-peptide or CIP-box?",
  "ideal_answer": "Crystallographic analysis classifies CIP-boxes into two related groups that target different sites on Ctf4. Mutations in the CIP-box motifs of the Dna2 nuclease or the rDNA-associated protein Tof2 do not perturb DNA synthesis genome-wide, but instead lead to a dramatic shortening of chromosome 12 that contains the large array of rDNA repeats. Data reveal unexpected complexity of Ctf4 function, as a hub that connects multiple accessory factors to the replisome. Most strikingly, Ctf4-dependent recruitment of CIP-box proteins couples other processes to DNA synthesis, including rDNA copy-number regulation.",
