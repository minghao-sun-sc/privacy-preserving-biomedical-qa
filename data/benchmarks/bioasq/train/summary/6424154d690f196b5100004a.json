  "question": "What is the R value with respect to hepatoxicity",
  "ideal_answer": "The R value is a measure of hepatotoxicity, which is calculated by dividing the peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level by the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT. A value of greater than 5 is considered to be indicative of hepatotoxicity.",

These clinical phenotypes can be characterized by latency, biochemical features (R-value), as well as clinical symptoms and signs. ",
