  "question": "What is known about depression in caregivers of brain tumor patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "Depression is common affecting up to 40% of caregivers of brain tumor patients. Depression is associated with poor quality of life of caregivers of brain tumor patients. Greater anxiety, patients\u2019 emotional distress, economic hardship, lower caregivers\u2019 age, lower income, less social support and lower patient functioning were associated with more caregivers\u2019 depressive symptoms. Reports of caregiver depressive symptoms were lower when paired with higher reports of spirituality. It is important to monitor and treat caregiver's depression.",
