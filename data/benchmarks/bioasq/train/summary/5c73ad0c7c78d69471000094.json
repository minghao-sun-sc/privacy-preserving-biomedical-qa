  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of cariprazine?",
  "ideal_answer": "Cariprazine is a dopamine D3/D2 partial agonist atypical antipsychotic with preferential binding to D3 receptors. Cariprazine shows also has affinity for 5-HT2B, and 5-HT1A receptors. It also shows moderate affinity toward \u03c31, 5-HT2A, and histamine H1 receptors. It is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder",
