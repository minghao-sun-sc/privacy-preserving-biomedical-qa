  "question": "What is the association between personality trait of neuroticism and risk for Alzheimer's disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "High neuroticism is associated with increased risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. Greater neuroticism is also associated more advanced Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and younger age of dementia onset. Neuroticism's association with late-life dementia mainly reflects vulnerability to stress and anxiety. Neuroticism moderates the relationship between APOE-4 genotype and cognitive outcomes in elderly. Neuroticism also predicts Mild Cognitive Impairment, Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline and cognitive decline among elderly. Alzheimer's disease patients have greater neuroticism relative to controls.",
