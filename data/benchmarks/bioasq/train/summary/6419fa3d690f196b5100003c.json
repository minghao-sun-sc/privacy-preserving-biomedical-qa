  "question": "What is the difference between siRNA and Antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics",
  "ideal_answer": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics are two classes of RNA-based therapeutics that are used to modulate gene expression. siRNAs are short double-stranded RNAs that bind to and degrade mRNA, while ASOs are single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind to mRNA and block its translation into protein.",
