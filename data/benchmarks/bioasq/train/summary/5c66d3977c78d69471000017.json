  "question": "What is PEGylation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Attachment of a chain of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to a therapeutic protein, a process widely known as PEGylation, can lead to several beneficial effects. It has the potential to significantly delay aggregation of the protein by steric shielding, a frequently encountered issue in the development of protein drugs. Moreover, it can modify the pharmacokinetic profile of the PEGylated protein by delaying renal excretion, leading to a longer half-life (t1/2) of the drug. By steric hindrance, it can also inhibit interactions between the protein drug and proteases as well as the host immune system, thereby inhibiting inactivation of the PEGylated protein and also attenuating its immunogenicity.",
