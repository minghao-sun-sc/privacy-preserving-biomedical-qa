The disease is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death usually within five years after the onset of symptoms. While most cases are sporadic, 5%-10% of cases can be associated with familial inheritance, including ALS type 6, which is associated with mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene.",
