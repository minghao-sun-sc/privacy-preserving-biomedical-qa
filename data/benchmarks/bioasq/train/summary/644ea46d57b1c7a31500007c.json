  "question": "What are genome-wide association studies (GWAS)?",
  "ideal_answer": "Each human has slightly different DNA sequences, called genetic variants, which make each of us unique. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an important avenue for undertaking an agnostic evaluation of the association between common genetic variants and the risk of disease. Recent advances in our understanding of human genetic variation and the technology to measure such variation have made GWAS feasible. Over the past few years, a multitude of GWAS has identified and replicated many associated variants. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets.",
