  "question": "What is the effect of HMGB2 loss on CTCF clustering?",
  "ideal_answer": "Depletion of the abundant HMGB2 protein occurs early on the path to senescence and coincides with the dramatic spatial clustering of CTCF. Knocking down HMGB2 suffices for senescence-induced CTCF clustering and for loop reshuffling, while ectopically expressing HMGB2 rescues these effects.",
