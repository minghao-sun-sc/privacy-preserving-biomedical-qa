  "ideal_answer": "Due to high volatility and environmental mobility, radioactive isotopes of iodine pose a serious risk in the acute phases of a nuclear accident. The critical organ for iodine is the thyroid. A number of studies dealing with thyroid protection from exposure to radioiodine have shown that radioiodine uptake by the thyroid can be effectively blocked by administration of stable iodine, usually in the form of potassium iodide (KI) pills.",
