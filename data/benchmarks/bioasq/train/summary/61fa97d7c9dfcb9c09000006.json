  "question": "Should edasalonexent be used for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. In phase 3 clinical trial edasalonexent did not achieve statistical significance for improvement in primary and secondary functional endpoints for assessment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, subgroup analysis suggested that edasalonexent may slow disease progression if initiated before 6 years of age.",

      "text": "Edasalonexent 100\u202fmg/kg was associated with slowing of disease progression and preservation of muscle function compared to an off-treatment control period, with decrease in levels of NF-\u03baB-regulated genes and improvements in biomarkers of muscle health and inflammation. These results support investigating edasalonexent in future trials and have informed the design of the edasalonexent phase 3 clinical trial in boys with Duchenne.",
