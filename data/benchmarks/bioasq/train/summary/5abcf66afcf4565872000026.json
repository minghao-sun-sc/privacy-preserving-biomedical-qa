  "question": "What is Dupuytren's contracture?",
  "ideal_answer": "Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive hand condition that affects how much you can move or straighten your fingers. It is a benign fibroproliferative disease leads to hyperplasia of the collagen fibers of the fascia of the palm, which can result in severe impairment of the functionality of the hand.",
