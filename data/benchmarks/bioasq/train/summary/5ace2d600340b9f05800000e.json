  "question": "What phenotype is associated with the V60L mutation in the human MC1R gene?",
  "ideal_answer": "The characterization of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on human melanocytes and the findings that certain mutations in the POMC gene or the MC1R gene result in red hair phenotype underscore the significance of melanocortins and MC1R in regulating human pigmentation. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Thus, at least in Spain, regions at opposite ends of the incident UV-B radiation distribution show significantly different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair), with higher frequency of V60L at those regions of lower incident UV-B radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Alleles associated with the red hair color (RHC) phenotype and with the risk of melanoma were examined.",
