  "question": "What is the effect of notch in the division of neural progenitor cells in Drosophila?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Notch pathway mediates the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in Drosophila. It's an important part of the development of neural stem cells, which are the cells that make up the brain. Notch/HES signaling and MIR-9 signaling are very important for the homeostasis of neural cells. It is thought that notch activation is responsible for the growth of neurons.",
