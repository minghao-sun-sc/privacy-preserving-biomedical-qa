  "question": "What is known about FANK1?",
  "ideal_answer": "Fank1 encodes a protein containing a fibronectin type III domain in the amino terminus and five ankyrin repeats in its carboxyl terminus. FANK1 displays a high degree of sequence conservation in 11 vertebrate species during evolution. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses revealed that Fank1 was exclusively expressed in the testis in both mice and humans.\nConsistent with its nuclear localization, a gene ontology analysis suggests that FANK1 has a DNA binding activity and thus may function as a transcription factor.",
