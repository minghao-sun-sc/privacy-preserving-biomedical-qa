  "ideal_answer": "The novel treatment strategy proposed for treatment of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is the removal of the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while maintaining important wild type functions of the protein.",

The expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene",
