  "question": "What is the \"wearing-off\" phenomenon in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's Disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Chronic administration of traditional levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor formulations to Paskinson's Disease patients is associated with the development of complications, such as wearing-off phenomenon. Wearing-off phenomenon is characterized by the predictable emergence of motor symptoms (e.g. rigidity and freezing) and nonmotor PD symptoms (e.g. anxiety and shortness of breath), before the next scheduled dose of medication.",
