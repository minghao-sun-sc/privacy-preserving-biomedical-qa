  "question": "What is Intanza?",
  "ideal_answer": "Intanza(r) 9 ug (sanofi pasteur) is a microneedle-delivered intradermal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine approved in 2009 for the prevention of seasonal influenza in adults 18 to 59 years of age. The microneedle system reliably and reproducibly delivers the vaccine to the dermis. Clinical studies show that Intanza 9 ug is as immunogenic and as well tolerated in working-age adults as a reference intramuscular trivalent inactivated vaccine. Local reactions to Intanza 9 ug, mainly erythema, are transient, mostly mild or moderate, and do not affect acceptability. Intanza 9 ug is considered satisfactory by at least 95% of both vaccinees and prescribers, especially because of the short needle and rapid administration.",
