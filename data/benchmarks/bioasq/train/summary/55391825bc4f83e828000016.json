  "question": "What are the effects of homozygosity of EDNRB mutations in addition to Hirschsprung disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene. RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. More recently, heterozygous EDNRB an EDN3 missense mutations have been reported in isolated HSCR patients  ",

      "text": "The index patient, who was born to a family with no history of Hirschsprung disease, presented total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel extension, sensorineural hearing loss and generalized cutaneous pigmentary defects. Interestingly, both irides were normally black. The study detected a homozygous missense mutation at codon 196 in exon 2 (Ser196Asn), which has not been reported. Both parents and four in six siblings harbored heterozygous mutation without any clinical manifestation. Our findings were consistent with previous observations that full spectrum of WS4 occurred to the mutate homozygotes. Moreover, the non-penetrance of heterozygotes in our pedigree, which differs from other reports, demonstrates the high pleiotropic effect of EDNRB mutations in human.",

      "text": "ABCD syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut (Hirschsprung disease [HSCR]), and deafness. This phenotype clearly overlaps with the features of the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, comprising sensorineural deafness; hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and irides; and HSCR. Therefore, we screened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for mutations in the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, a gene known to be involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 (R201X) of the EDNRB gene was found. We therefore suggest that ABCD syndrome is not a separate entity, but an expression of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.",
