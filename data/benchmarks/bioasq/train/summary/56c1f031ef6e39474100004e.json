  "ideal_answer": "Hot water epilepsy (HWE) refers to a specific type of reflex epilepsy precipitated by the stimulus of bathing in hot water. Pathogenesis is still unknown and temporal lobe has been thought to take part in the epileptogenesis. HWE can be symptomatic of focal cortical malformation, and few cases were reported. Intermittent clobazam prophylaxis prior to head water bath might be a preferred mode of treatment of pure HWE.",
