  "question": "What is known about the protein Curli?",
  "ideal_answer": "A major component of bacterial biofilms is curli amyloid fibrils secreted by the curli biogenesis system.\nCurli is a bacterial \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system.\ncurli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. In mice overexpressing the human amyloid \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), we reveal that colonization with curli-producing Escherichia coli promotes \u03b1Syn pathology in the gut and the brain. Curli expression is required for E. coli to exacerbate \u03b1Syn-induced behavioral deficits, including intestinal and motor impairments. Purified curli subunits accelerate \u03b1Syn aggregation in biochemical assays, while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities.",
