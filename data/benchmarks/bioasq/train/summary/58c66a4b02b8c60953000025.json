  "question": "Which are the main brain dysfunctions caused by hyperbilirubinemia?",
  "ideal_answer": "Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and classical kernicterus are the main dysfunctions of hyperbilirubinemia, whenever bilirubin levels exceed the capacity of the brain defensive mechanisms in preventing its entrance and cytotoxicity. Bilirubin accumulation may lead to deficits in auditory, cognitive, and motor processing, due to neuronal cell death, reduced myelination and glial activation.",
