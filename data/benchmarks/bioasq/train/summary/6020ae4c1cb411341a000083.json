  "ideal_answer": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported an increased risk of cancer with lorcaserin in the follow-up of the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial. However, subsequent meta-analysis did not confirm the increased risk of cancer with lorcaserin but suggests a trend in this direction, with a greater incidence of some subtypes such as lung and pancreas.",

The result was heavily influenced by the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial. In this study, the lorcaserin group had a higher risk of lung and pancreatic but not colon cancer. ",
