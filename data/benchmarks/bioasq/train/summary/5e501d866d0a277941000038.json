Nextflow is a flow management framework that uses container technology to insure efficient deployment and reproducibility of computational analysis pipelines. Third party pipelines can be ported into Nextflow with minimum re-coding.",

Nextflow is a flow management framework that uses container technology to insure efficient deployment and reproducibility of computational analysis pipelines. Third party pipelines can be ported into Nextflow with minimum re-coding. We used RNA-Seq quantification, genome annotation and phylogeny reconstruction examples to show how two seemingly irreproducible analyzes can be made stable across platforms when ported into Nextflow.",
