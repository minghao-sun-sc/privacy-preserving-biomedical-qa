  "question": "What is CardioClassifier?",
  "ideal_answer": "CardioClassifier (http://www.cardioclassifier.org) is a semiautomated decision support tool for clinical genome interpretation. CardioClassifier integrates data retrieved from multiple sources with user-input case-specific information, through an interactive interface, to support variant interpretation. CardioClassifier identified putatively disease-causing variants in 33.7% of 327 cardiomyopathy cases, comparable with leading ICC laboratories. Through addition of manually curated data, variants found in over 40% of cardiomyopathy cases are fully annotated, without requiring additional user-input data.",
