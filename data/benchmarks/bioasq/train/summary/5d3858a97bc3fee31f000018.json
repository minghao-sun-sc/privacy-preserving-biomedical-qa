  "question": "What is the basis of the methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq) method?",
  "ideal_answer": "MPE-seq (methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing) is a new method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei with MPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing of the whole genome. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MNase preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MP e-seq relative to MNase. Moreover, unlike MNase, MPe-seq cleaves nuclear DNA",
