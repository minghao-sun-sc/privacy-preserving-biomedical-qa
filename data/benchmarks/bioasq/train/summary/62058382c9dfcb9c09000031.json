  "question": "Why mix \u03b3-cyclodextrin with grapefruit juice?",
  "ideal_answer": "Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) juice enhances the oral bioavailability of drugs that are metabolized by intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Patients are advised to avoid drinking grapefruit juice to prevent this drug-grapefruit juice interaction. The inhibition of CYP3A by grapefruit juice was significantly attenuated by processing particularly with \u03b3CD. The inhibition of CYP3A by grapefruit juice was significantly attenuated by processing particularly with \u03b3CD. Similar attenuation effects by \u03b3CD were observed in the cases of BG and DHBG. Furthermore, BG and DHBG were suggested to be strongly encapsulated in the cavity of \u03b3CD.The encapsulation of BG and DHBG by \u03b3CD and the resulting attenuation of the inhibition of CYP3A activity by grapefruit juice may be applicable to juice processing for preventing drug-grapefruit juice interactions.",
