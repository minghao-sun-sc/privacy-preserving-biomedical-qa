      "text": "We found that EREG expression was significantly higher in GC tissues than in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. High EREG protein expression in GC was significantly associated with TNM stage including tumor size, lymph node metastases and distant metastases as well as poor overall survival. These finding demonstrate that EREG is an independent prognostic biomarker for GC.",
