  "question": "What is rebound COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "Rebound COVID-19 refers to the recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement and/or increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral levels following initial decline within the first few weeks following infection. Increasing reports have described symptom and viral rebound following nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) use. The frequency of rebound COVID-19 following nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is uncertain; some studies have reported rates of 1 to 5 percent. Recurrent symptoms are typically mild. Rebound is not unique to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and has been described in individuals with COVID-19 who have not received antiviral treatment.",
