  "question": "Which is the definition of pyknons in DNA?",
  "ideal_answer": "Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions. They are found more frequently in the 3' untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome.",
