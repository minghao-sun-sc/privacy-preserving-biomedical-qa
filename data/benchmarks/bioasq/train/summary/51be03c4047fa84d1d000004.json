  "question": "Describe the known functions for the prothymosin alpha c-terminal peptide?",
  "ideal_answer": "Prothymosin alpha (ProT\u03b1) (encoded in human by the PTMA gene) is a ubiquitous, highly acidic nuclear polypeptide. During early apoptosis, proT\u03b1 is cleaved by activated caspase-3, with a primary attach site being D99, close to its carboxyl-terminus. The role of the cleaved decapeptide -- proT\u03b1(100-109) -- is not fully understood. proT\u03b1(100-109), which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) for ProT\u03b1, has been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory properties, such as to stimulate lymphocytes and neutrophils and induce dendritic cell maturation.",
