  "question": "What is a regulon?",
  "ideal_answer": "Regulons are the basic units of the cellular response system in bacterial cells, and each consists of a set of transcriptionally co-regulated operons. While the term \"regulon\" is not used in eukaryotes, a group of genes controlled as a unit - usually by the same repressor or activator gene - can be referred to as a regulon.",
