  "ideal_answer": "The dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.  Dental follicle cells attach to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS), and pulp cells in the cementum promoting cementogenesis. The  temporospatial regulation of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts.",
