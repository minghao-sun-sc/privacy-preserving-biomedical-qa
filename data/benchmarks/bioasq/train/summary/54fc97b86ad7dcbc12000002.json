  "question": "What is known about clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "There have been a few case reports to suggest that ceftriaxone can be effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, other case reports did not report clinical benefit of ceftriaxone therapy for ALS. Ceftriaxone has been reported to reduce neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a through increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter, GLT1. Clinical trials investigating potential clinical benefits of ceftriaxone in ALS are ongoing.",
