  "question": "Where is the proteasome located?",
  "ideal_answer": "The proteasome can be found in perinuclear and nuclear location, as well as in cytosolic compartments, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, production and loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA molecules, and transient homing of diverse virion proteins required for entry and/or egress have been also shown to be coordinated at the centrosome.",
