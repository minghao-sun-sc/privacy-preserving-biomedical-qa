  "question": "What is an organoid?",
  "ideal_answer": "Organoids are a three-dimensional in vitro culture platform constructed from self-organizing stem cells. They can almost accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment \"in a dish,\" which surpass established cell lines and are not as expensive and time-consuming as PDTXs. As an intermediate model, tumor organoids are also used to study the fundamental issues of tumorigenesis and metastasis. They are specifically applied for drug testing and stored as \"living biobanks.\"",
