We have engineered novel virus-like-particle (VLP) technology that is able to display complex libraries of random peptide sequences on a surface-exposed loop in the coat protein without disruption of protein folding or VLP assembly. This technology allows us to use the same VLP particle for both affinity selection and immunization, integrating the power of epitope discovery and epitope mimicry of traditional phage display with the high immunogenicity of VLPs.",

After three rounds of biopanning, 12 phages were selected for each mAbs and their specificity to IBDV was verified by sandwich and competitive inhibition ELISAs. Seven phages per mAb were sequenced and their amino acid sequences were deduced. The five representative sequences of mimotopes corresponding mAbs were determined. An artificial gene, designated 5epis (5 epitopes) and consisting of the five mimotopes arranged in tandem (F1-F7-B34-2B1-2G8) with four GGGS spacers, was chemically synthesized and cloned into a prokaryotic expression plasmid pET28b.
