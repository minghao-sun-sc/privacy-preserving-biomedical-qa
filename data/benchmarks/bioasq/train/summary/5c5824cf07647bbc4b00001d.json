  "question": "What is TPMCalculator?",
  "ideal_answer": "The quantification of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) abundance using a normalization method that calculates transcripts per million (TPM) is a key step to compare multiple samples from different experiments. TPMCalculator is a one-step software to process RNA-seq alignments in BAM format and reports TPM values, raw read counts and feature lengths for genes, transcripts, exons and introns. The program describes the genomic features through a model generated from the gene transfer format (GTF) file used during alignments reporting of the TPM values and the raw read counts for each feature.",
