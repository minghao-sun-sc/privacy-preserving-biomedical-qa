  "question": "Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) transfer acetyl groups from acetyl CoA to lysine residues on histones. What is the purpose of this transfer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Histone acetylation is a critical epigenetic modification that changes chromatin architecture and regulates gene expression by opening or closing the chromatin structure. It relaxes DNA coiling around histones and allows transcription factors to bind promoter regions and promote increased gene expression via transcription.",
