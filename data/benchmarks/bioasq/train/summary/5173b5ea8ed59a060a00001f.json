  "question": "Which histone modifications have been associated to alternative splicing?",
  "ideal_answer": "H3K36m3 has been systematically associated to exon inclusion in almost all published studies. Other marks have been associated as well in specific studies to exon expression, but it can not be concluded that the effect of these marks in exon expression it is not a consequence of their effect in gene expression.",
