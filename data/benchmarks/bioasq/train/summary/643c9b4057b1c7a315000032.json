  "question": "What are promoters?",
  "ideal_answer": "A promoter is generally defined to be the sequence that directs the initiation of transcription. This simple definition belies a diverse and complex transcriptional module. There are two major types of core promoters - focused and dispersed. Focused promoters contain either a single transcription start site or a distinct cluster of start sites over several nucleotides, whereas dispersed promoters contain several start sites over 50-100 nucleotides.\n\nIn summary, promoters are short regions of DNA (100-1,000 bp) where transcription by RNA polymerase begins. They are typically located directly upstream or at the 5' end of the transcription initiation site.",

The modular nature of promoters is supported by the observation that many cis-acting elements retain their activities when they are taken out of their native promoter context and used as building blocks in synthetic promoters.",
