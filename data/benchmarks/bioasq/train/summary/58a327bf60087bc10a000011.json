  "question": "What are Septins?",
  "ideal_answer": "Septins are an evolutionarily conserved family of GTP-binding proteins. They are involved in diverse processes including cytokinesis, apoptosis, infection, neurodegeneration and neoplasia. In yeast, septins assemble into a highly ordered array of filaments at the mother bud neck in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Septins have been implicated in a diverse range of cancers, including gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",
