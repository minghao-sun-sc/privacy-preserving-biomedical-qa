  "question": "What is Morgellons disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "It is a skin condition in which individuals have skin lesions that contain some kind of fibers. Patients often complain of bugs crawling under their skin. The disease is of unknown origin and may be psychosomatic, however recent evidence indicates it could be transmitted by a tick.",
