  "question": "What is DeepCAGE?",
  "ideal_answer": "The cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) technology has been established to detect transcriptional starting sites (TSSs) and expression levels by utilizing 5' cDNA tags and PCR. It has been reported that the amount of templates is proportional to the amplification efficiency of PCR. CAGE has been used as a key technique for analyzing promoter activity and finding new transcripts including alternative spliced products and noncoding transcripts. DeepCAGE can be utilized for high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology. DeepCAGE can produce much deeper transcriptome datasets and can reveal more details of the regulatory network.",
