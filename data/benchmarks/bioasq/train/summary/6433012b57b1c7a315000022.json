  "ideal_answer": "Intravenous nanofiltered human C1 inhibitor (C1-INH NF) concentrate (Cinryze\u00ae) is used as a direct replacement of deficient levels of plasma C1 inhibitor in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). In the EU, C1-INH NF concentrate 1000\u2009U is indicated in the treatment, pre-procedural prevention, and routine prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with HAE. Intravenous C1-INH NF concentrate 1000\u2009U effectively relieved angioedema attacks in patients with HAE.",
