  "ideal_answer": "Target Explorer is an automated tool for the identification of new target genes for a specified set of transcription factors. It was specifically designed for the well-annotated Drosophila melanogaster genome, but most options can be used for sequences from other genomes as well. Target Explorer is available at http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/Target_Explorer/",
