  "question": "What is the function of the YY1 transcriptional regulator?",
  "ideal_answer": "The ubiquitous transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is known to have a fundamental role in normal biologic processes such as embryogenesis, differentiation, replication, and cellular proliferation. YY1 is a transcription factor that can activate or repress transcription of a variety of genes and is involved in several developmental processes. YY1 overexpression and/or activation is associated with unchecked cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, tumorigenesis and metastatic potential. YY1, in addition to its regulatory roles in normal biologic processes, may possess the potential to act as an initiator of tumorigenesis and may thus serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker; furthermore, it may provide an effective target for antitumor chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy.",

The absence of any co-operative effect when CHO cells were co-transfected with both YY1 and Pur alpha cDNA species suggests that two different transcription regulatory mechanisms could have a role in the regulation of the FE65 gene.",
