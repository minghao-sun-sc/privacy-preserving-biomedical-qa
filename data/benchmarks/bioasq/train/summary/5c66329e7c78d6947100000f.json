  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of durvalumab?",
  "ideal_answer": "Durvalumab is a selective, high-affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 and CD80, but not to PD-L2. It is Immune checkpoint inhibitor used of treating advanced cancer patients, principally antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD-L1.",
