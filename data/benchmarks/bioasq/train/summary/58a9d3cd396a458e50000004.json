  "ideal_answer": "Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to induce exon 51 skipping that is developed by Sarepta Therapeutics. Intravenous eteplirsen has received accelerated approval from the US FDA for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.\nBy the method of exon skipping in dystrophin pre-mRNA the reading frame is restored and the internally deleted but functional dystrophin is produced.",
