  "question": "What is the function of the mammalian gene Irg1?",
  "ideal_answer": "Human IRG1 and mouse Irg1 mediates antiviral and antimicrobial immune responses, without its exact role having been elucidated. Irg1 has been suggested to have a role in apoptosis and to play a significant role in embryonic implantation. Irg1 is reported as the mammalian ortholog of methylcitrate dehydratase.",
