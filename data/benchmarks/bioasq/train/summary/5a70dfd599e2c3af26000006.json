  "ideal_answer": "Dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria, or undesirable feeling that occurs with the MER and continues for no more than a few minutes. After milk ejection, the dysphoria vanishes. Symptoms may decrease by 3 months or they may continue throughout the breastfeeding period.",
