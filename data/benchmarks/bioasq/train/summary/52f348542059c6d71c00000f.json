  "question": "what is the role of prostaglandins in cardiac regenaration after myocardial infarction?",
  "ideal_answer": "Prostaglandins are involved in tissue regeneration after myocardial infarction and inhibitors of prostanoid production, such as aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors, have negative impact in this process. Furthermore, pharmacological interference with prostaglandin synthesis following myocardial infarction is associated with reduced fibrillar collagen formation.",

      "text": "This indicated different cyclooxygenase (COX)-downstream synthases and metabolizing enzymes are involved in the AA products' signaling through the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. The presence of many enzymes' and receptors' [(COX-1, COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES), cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (cPGES), prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS), the PGE(2) subtype receptors (EP(1), EP(2), and EP(4)) and the prostacyclin receptor (IP)] involvement in the prostanoid biosynthesis and activity was confirmed by western blot. The studies implied the negative effects of NSAIDs, such as aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors, which suppress prostanoid production during tissue regeneration for infarcted heart when using hESCs.",

Though the mechanism responsible for observed alteration in fibrogenesis is uncertain, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties of these agents may be responsible.",
