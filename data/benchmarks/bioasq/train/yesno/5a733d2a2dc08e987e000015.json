  "question": "Is Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis. Its efficacy was proven in clinical trials. Tocilizumab may exert its therapeutic effects in Giant-Cell Arteritis by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease.",
