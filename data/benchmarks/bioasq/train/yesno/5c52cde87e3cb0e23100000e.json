  "question": "Does allele phasing improve the phylogenetic utility of ultraconserved elements?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Allele phasing greatly improves the phylogenetic utility of ultraconserved elements. Analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",

      "text": "Our empirical analyses of Ultraconserved Element (UCE) locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last three million years. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species, and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",
