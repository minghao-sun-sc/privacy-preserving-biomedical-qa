  "question": "Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Although initial studies have provided with encouraging findings regarding administration of magnesium sulphate in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage patients, but subsequent larger studies have reported that intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.",
