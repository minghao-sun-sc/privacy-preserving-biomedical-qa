  "question": "Are there clinical trials on stem cells in multiple sclerosis",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes.  Human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis. Several small pilot clinical trials in subjects with advanced MS have demonstrated that MSC administration is safe and provided an early signal of clinical effectiveness. The current aim of clinicians and scientists interested in the development of MSC-based strategies for the treatment of MS is to have the ultimate demonstration in large clinical trials that MSC can inhibit CNS inflammation and foster tissue repair.",
