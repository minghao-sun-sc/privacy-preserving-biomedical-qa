      "text": "PRP-40 is particularly required for inclusion of neuronal microexons, and our data indicate that PRP-40 is a central regulator of microexon splicing. Microexons can be relieved from PRP-40 dependence by artificially increasing exon size or reducing flanking intron size, indicating that PRP-40 is specifically required for microexons surrounded by conventionally sized introns. Knockdown of the orthologous PRPF40A in mouse neuroblastoma cells causes widespread dysregulation of microexons but not conventionally sized exons. PRP-40 regulation of neuronal microexons is therefore a widely conserved phenomenon.",
