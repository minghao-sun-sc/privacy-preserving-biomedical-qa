  "question": "Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, Klinefelter syndrome is associated with increased risk of male breast cancer. Other risk factors of male breast cancer are positive family history, and mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2.",
