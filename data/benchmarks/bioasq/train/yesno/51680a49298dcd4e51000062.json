AZD1152 had anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model. There preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in BL and HL.",

The antiapoptotic properties of survivin might provide a significant growth advantage in tumors and possibly also contribute to chemoresistance of cancer.",

Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2. Collectively, these studies identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis.",
