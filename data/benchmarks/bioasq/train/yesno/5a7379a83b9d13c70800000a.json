  "question": "Is Rucaparib effective for ovarian cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation identified by an approved companion diagnostic test.",
