  "question": "Does the concentration of protein HIF-1\u03b1 increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug\"amifostine\" (ethyol) ?",
  "ideal_answer": "The key-protein that when associated with HREs leads to the activation of all of these genes, is identified as\u201cHypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u201d (HIF1). It is a heterodimer composed of two subunits (IIF1a 120kDa and HIF-1b 91-94kDa), both of which belong to the group of \"basic helix-loop-helix\" (bHLH)-Pas proteins. The heterodimer HIF1 and IIF2 increase in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to hypoxia.",

A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively. Complete response was obtained in 85.2% of patients and HIF1alpha was marginally related with persistent disease after RT (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha was significantly associated with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.008), whilst HIF2alpha was no",
