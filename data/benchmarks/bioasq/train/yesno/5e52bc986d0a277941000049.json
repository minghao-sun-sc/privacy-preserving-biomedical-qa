      "text": "A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 \u00d7 10(-8)) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 \u00d7 10(-9) after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 \u00d7 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 \u00d7 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 \u00d7 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 \u00d7 10(-13)). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed.",
