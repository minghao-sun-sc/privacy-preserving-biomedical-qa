      "text": "Here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if Z \u223c 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric one based upon the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z \u223c 1/X in nine out of 11 taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group. Rather than a fact, Z \u223c 1/X is a baseline that real genomes do not meet. The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed.",
