  "question": "Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus?",
  "ideal_answer": "Botulinum toxin, which causes botulism, is not expected to be present in systemic circulation following proper intramuscular or intradermal injection. Moreover, botulinum toxin has a high molecular weight, and does not appear to cross the placenta. Based on the study cases reported in the literature, botulism poisoning during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of adverse outcome in the fetus.",
