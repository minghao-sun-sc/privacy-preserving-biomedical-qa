  "question": "Does PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?",
  "ideal_answer": "Recent data demonstrate that developmental transcription factors like the macrophage fate-determining Pu.1 set the stage for the activity of ubiquitous transcription factors activated by inflammatory stimuli, like NF-kB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Within 1217 bp of upstream sequence, 3 sites for NF-kB, 10 sites for NF-IL6, 15 sites for AP1, 6 sites for AP4, 2 sites for CHOP/CEBP alpha and 1 site for SP1 and PU.1 were identified.",
