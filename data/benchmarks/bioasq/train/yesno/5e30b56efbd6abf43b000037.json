  "question": "Is the BAGEL algorithm used for arrayed CRISPR screens?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. BAGEL (Bayesian Analysis of Gene EssentiaLity) is a supervised learning method for analyzing pooled library gene knockout screens. It offers significantly greater sensitivity than current methods, while computational optimizations reduce runtime by an order of magnitude.",

      "text": "The adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to pooled library gene knockout screens in mammalian cells represents a major technological leap over RNA interference, the prior state of the art. New methods for analyzing the data and evaluating results are needed.RESULTS: We offer BAGEL (Bayesian Analysis of Gene EssentiaLity), a supervised learning method for analyzing gene knockout screens. Coupled with gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, BAGEL offers significantly greater sensitivity than current methods, while computational optimizations reduce runtime by an order of magnitude.CONCLUSIONS: Using BAGEL, we identify ~2000 fitness genes in pooled library knockout screens in human cell lines at 5 % FDR, a major advance over competing platforms. BAGEL shows high sensitivity and specificity even across screens performed by different labs using different libraries and reagents.",
