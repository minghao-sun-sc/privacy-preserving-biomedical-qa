  "question": "Are there randomised controlled trials on sevoflurane?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. There are < 10 studies reported, answering questions like : how to improve speed of recovery, relationship to dreaming and anesthetic experience, effect on cardiac troponin release, effect on myocardial injury, postoperative delirium,  haemodynamics & emergence and recovery characteristics of total intravenous anaesthesia,  costs of postoperative nausea and vomiting, pediatric conscious sedation for dental procedures",
