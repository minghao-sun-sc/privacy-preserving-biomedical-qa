  "question": "Can other vaccines be given with COVID-19 vaccine?",
  "ideal_answer": "Although there are no data regarding safety and efficacy when COVID-19 vaccines are co-administered with other vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that COVID-19 vaccines can be administered at any time in relation to other non-COVID-19 vaccines, and if needed, can be administered on the same day as other vaccines. This is based on the experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines, where the immunogenicity and adverse event profiles were generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously or alone.\n\nFurthermore, in a randomized trial, frequency of adverse effects and immunogenicity were largely similar when a COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1) was given concomitantly with either an influenza vaccine or placebo.",

      "text": "Concomitant vaccination with ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 plus an age-appropriate influenza vaccine raises no safety concerns and preserves antibody responses to both vaccines. Concomitant vaccination with both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines over the next immunisation season should reduce the burden on health-care services for vaccine delivery, allowing for timely vaccine administration and protection from COVID-19 and influenza for those in need.",
