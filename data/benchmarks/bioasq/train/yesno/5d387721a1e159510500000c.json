In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant, c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7 variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05)",
