  "question": "Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials. However, a recent large clinical trial showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials.",
