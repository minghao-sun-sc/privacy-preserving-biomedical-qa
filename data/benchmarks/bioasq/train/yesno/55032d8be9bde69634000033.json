  "ideal_answer": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Thymectomy can also increase risk for osteoporosis. Appropriate osteoporosis preventive measures can reduce osteoporosis risk in MG patients.",
