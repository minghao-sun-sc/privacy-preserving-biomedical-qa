  "question": "Can the epigenetic status of introns affect gene expression?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, the epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression. Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation in introns can regulate alternative splicing and affect the level of gene expression. Additionally, histone modifications in introns can also affect chromatin structure and gene expression.",

As is the case with dysfunction of ASI1 and EDM2, dysfunction of AIPP1 impedes the use of distal polyadenylation sites at tested intronic HC-containing genes, such as the histone demethylase gene IBM1, resulting in a lack of functional full-length transcripts.",
