  "question": "Is cohesin linked to myeloid differentiation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. There has been a link found between cohesin and myeloid differentiation which may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia.",

      "text": "Consistent with a role for inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia.",
