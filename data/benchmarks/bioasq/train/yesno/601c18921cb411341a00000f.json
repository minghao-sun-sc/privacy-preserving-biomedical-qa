The best systemic effect was obtained with 50 mg/kg, symptomatic--100 mg/kg. Skin wounds treated with 5% olipiphate (26 + 2) healed faster than those treated with 2% solcoseryl (30 + 0.8) or in control (33 + 0.6). It was shown histologically that the proliferative and antiphlogistic effect of olipiphate involved no scars.",
