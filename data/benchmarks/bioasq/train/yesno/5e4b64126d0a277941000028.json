  "ideal_answer": "No. Phase III trials of the anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) antibody figitumumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have been discontinued owing to lack of survival benefit.  Adding figitumumab to standard chemotherapy also failed to increase overall survival in patients with advanced nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.",
