  "question": "Are somatic mutations positioned towards the nuclear periphery?",
  "ideal_answer": "lamina-associated regions, which are typically localized at the nuclear periphery, displayed higher somatic mutation frequencies than did the interlamina regions at the nuclear core. Smoking and UV-related signatures, as well as substitutions at certain motifs, were more enriched in the nuclear periphery.",
