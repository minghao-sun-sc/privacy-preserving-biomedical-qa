  "question": "Can autophagy related lncRNAs be used for colorectal cancer prognosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, a prognostic prediction model of CRC was built based on nine ARlncRNAs (NKILA, LINC00174, AC008760.1, LINC02041, PCAT6, AC156455.1, LINC01503, LINC00957, and CD27-AS1). The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group among train set, validation set, and all patients (all p < 0.001). The model had high sensitivity and accuracy in predicting the 1-year overall survival rate (area under the curve = 0.717). The prediction model risk score was an independent predictor of CRC.",
