  "question": "Are there graph kernel libraries available implemented in JAVA?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Measuring the similarity of graphs is a fundamental step in the analysis of graph-structured data, which is omnipresent in computational biology. Graph kernels have been proposed as a powerful and efficient approach to this problem of graph comparison. Graphkernels are the first R and Python graph kernel libraries including baseline kernels such as label histogram based kernels, classic graph kernels such as random walk based kernels, and the state-of-the-art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The core of all graph kernels is implemented in C\u2009++ for efficiency. Using the kernel matrices computed by the package, one can perform tasks such as classification, regression and clustering on graph-structured samples.",
