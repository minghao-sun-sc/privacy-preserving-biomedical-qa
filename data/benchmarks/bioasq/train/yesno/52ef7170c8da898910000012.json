  "question": "Is CD84 genetically associated with arthritis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit polymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, notably in mice, but also in some human populations. Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with Rheumatoid Arthritis disease activity.",
