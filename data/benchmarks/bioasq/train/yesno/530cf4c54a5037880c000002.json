  "question": "Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure for noninvasive respiratory support of preterm infants after extubation. However, the use of high-flow nasal cannulae in preterm infants was shown to be associated with a higher rate of reintubation, increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support. High-flow nasal cannulae are also effective for treatment of apnea of prematurity.",
