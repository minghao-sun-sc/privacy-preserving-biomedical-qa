  "question": "Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?",
  "ideal_answer": "Perioperative administration of synthetic thyroid hormone therapy have positive hemodynamic effects (consisting of increases cardiac output, lowered systemic vascular resistance) determining improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, in the absence of relevant effects on outcome ad exception of lower incidence of atrial fibrillation.",
