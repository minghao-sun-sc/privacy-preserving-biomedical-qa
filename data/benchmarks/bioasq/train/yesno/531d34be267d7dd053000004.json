  "question": "Has the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?",
  "ideal_answer": "There are contrasting literature data on the presence of delayed enhancement, as a sign of myocardial fibrosis, in healthy athletes. More studies are necessary to define the presence, incidence and severity, as well clinical and prognostic meaning, of delayed enhancement magnetic resonance in healthy athletes.",
