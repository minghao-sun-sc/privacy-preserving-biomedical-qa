  "question": "Does fibronectin constitute a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?",
  "ideal_answer": "Compared to age-matched controls, fibronectin levels in DMD patients were found to be significantly increased, whereas in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, or myasthenia gravis were close to the control levels. Additionally, progressive elevation in fibronectin levels was observed in longitudinal samples from DMD patients followed up for a period of 6 months up to 4 years. Therefore, fibronectin is a serum biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
