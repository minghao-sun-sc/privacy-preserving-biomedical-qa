  "question": "Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?",
  "ideal_answer": "ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes.",
