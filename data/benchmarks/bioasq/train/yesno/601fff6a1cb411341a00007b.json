  "question": "Are there sex differences in oncogenic mutational processes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Sex differences have been observed in multiple facets of cancer epidemiology, treatment and biology, and in most cancers outside the sex organs. There are sex-biases in coding and non-coding cancer drivers, mutation prevalence and strikingly, in mutational signatures related to underlying mutational processes.",
