      "text": "Pericarditis is regarded as a stereotypical response to an acute damage of the mesothelial cells of the pericardial layers. NLRP3 inflammasome, a macromolecular structure sensing damage and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, is centrally involved as it releases interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, whose auto-induction feeds an autoinflammatory disease, mostly responsible for recurrences. Colchicine, an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and IL-1-targeted therapies, such as anakinra and rilonacept, were found to effectively blunt the acute inflammation and reduce the risk for recurrences.",
