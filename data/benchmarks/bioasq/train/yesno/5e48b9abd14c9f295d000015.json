  "question": "Are multipotent adult progenitor cells effective for treatment of stroke?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. There was no difference between the multipotent adult progenitor cell group and placebo groups in global stroke recovery at day 90. Further clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in an earlier time window after stroke (<36 h) are planned.",

Although no significant improvement was observed at 90 days in neurological outcomes with multipotent adult progenitor cells treatment, further clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in an earlier time window after stroke (<36 h) are planned.",
