  "question": "Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Stridor has been described in Parkinon's disease patients. Stridor has been linked to deep brain stimulation and L-Dopa medication use. \nHowever, stridor was shown to be more common in multiple system atrophy patients.",
