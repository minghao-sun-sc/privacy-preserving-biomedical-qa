Further in vivo studies confirmed the effect of Crocus sativus extract (50 mg/kg/day, added to mice diet) on the BBB tightness and function that was associated with reduced A\u03b2 load and related pathological changes in 5XFAD mice used as an AD model. Reduced A\u03b2 load could be explained, at least in part, by Crocus sativus extract effect to enhance A\u03b2 clearance pathways including BBB clearance, enzymatic degradation and ApoE clearance pathway.",
