  "question": "Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, ospamifene is effective for treatment of dyspareunia. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal women. Ospemifene is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.",
