  "ideal_answer": "In some studies of breast cancer, quantitation of immunohistochemically highlighted microvessel \u2018hot spots\u2019 has been shown to be a powerful prognostic tool. However, the antibody used, the number and size of the \u2018hot spots\u2019 assessed, and the stratification of patients into high and low vascular groups vary between studies. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between microvessel density and other vascular parameters. These uncertainties and the laborious nature of the technique make it unsuitable for diagnostic practice. Both manual and computerized image analysis techniques were used in this study to examine the relationship between microvessel density and the vascular parameters in different sized microscopic fields in a pilot series of 30 invasive breast carcinomas. Automated pixel analysis of immunohistochemical staining, Chalkley point counting, and observer subjective vascular grading were also assessed as more rapid methods of measuring tumour vascularity",
