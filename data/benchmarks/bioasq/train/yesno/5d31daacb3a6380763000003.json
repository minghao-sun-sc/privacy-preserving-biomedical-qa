  "question": "Are the members of the KRAB-ZNF  gene family promoting gene repression?",
  "ideal_answer": "The stem cell zinc finger 1 (SZF1)/ZNF589 protein belongs to the large family of Kruppel-associated box domain-zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcription factors, which are present only in higher vertebrates and epigenetically repress transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes to the promoter regions of their respective target genes Because KAP1 is recruited to the DNA via interaction with KRAB-ZNF proteins, we suggest that expression of KRAB-ZNF genes may be controlled via an auto-regulatory mechanism involving KAP1.",
