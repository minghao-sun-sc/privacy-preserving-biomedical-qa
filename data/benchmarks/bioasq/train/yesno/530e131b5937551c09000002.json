  "question": "Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?",
  "ideal_answer": "Statin use after subarachnoid hemorrhage has been shown be associated with improved outcomes by some prospective clinical trials. It has been reported that statin use after subarachnoid hemorrhage reduced rates of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality. However, other authors have failed to find beneficial effect of statin use in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.",
