  "question": "Is Stat4 a transcription factor?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, Stat4 is a transcription factor.\nStat4 is a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of molecules that localizes to the cytoplasm. STAT4 regulates various genes expression as a transcription factor after it is phosphorylated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus.",
