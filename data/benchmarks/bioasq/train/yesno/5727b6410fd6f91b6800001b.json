  "question": "Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?",
  "ideal_answer": "Moebius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius syndrome with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in early studies with heterogenous age groups.",

      "text": "The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some cases",
