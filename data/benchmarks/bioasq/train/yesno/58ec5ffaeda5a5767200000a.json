  "question": "Is dexamethasone recommended for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids should be avoided for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage because they do not improve patient outcome and are associated with increased risk of side effects.",

      "text": "During the third interim analysis, the death rate at the 21st day was identical in the two groups (dexamethasone vs. placebo, 21 of 46 vs. 21 of 47; chi-square = 0.01, P = 0.93). In contrast, the rate of complications (mostly infections and complications of diabetes) was much higher in the dexamethasone group (chi-square = 10.89, P less than 0.001), leading to early termination of the study. In the light of the absence of a demonstrable beneficial effect and the presence of a significant harmful effect, current practices of using dexamethasone for treatment of primary supratentorial hemorrhage should be reconsidered.",
