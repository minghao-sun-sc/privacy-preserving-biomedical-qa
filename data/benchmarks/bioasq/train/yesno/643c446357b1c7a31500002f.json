  "question": "Can reinfection occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection?",
  "ideal_answer": "Protective and detectable immune responses are induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection but it is not yet established to what degree and for how long protection against reinfection lasts. Evidence suggests that some of these responses can be detected for at least a year following infection.\n\nThe short-term risk of reinfection (e.g., within the first several months after initial infection) is low. Several studies estimated the risk of reinfection to be less than 1 percent in the subsequent 5-8 months following initial infection. The risk of reinfection may be greater with the Omicron variant.",
