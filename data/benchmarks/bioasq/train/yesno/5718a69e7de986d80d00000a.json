  "question": "Is Alpers disease inherited in an autosomal recessive mode?",
  "ideal_answer": "Alpers disease is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease.",
