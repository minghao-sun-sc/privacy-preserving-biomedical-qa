  "question": "Does Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) have a role only in late development?",
  "ideal_answer": "Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) has been described as a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. By both loss and gain of function approaches ablation of GRG5 has been shown to deregulate the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential.",
