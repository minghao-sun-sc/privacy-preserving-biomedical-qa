  "question": "Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, paroxetine is effective and FDA approved treatment of women with  premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A number of well designed clinical trials have confirmed efficacy and safety of both continuous or intermittent regiments of paroxetine for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A number of other antidepressants and hormaonal therapies were also shown to be effective and are FDA approved for treatment of women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.",
