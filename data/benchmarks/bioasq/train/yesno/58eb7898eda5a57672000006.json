  "question": "Are the genes for marneral biosynthesis scattered in the genome of A. thaliana?",
  "ideal_answer": "These clusters are unlikely to have arisen by horizontal gene transfer, and the mechanisms behind their formation are poorly understood. Here we characterize a second operon-like triterpene cluster (the marneral cluster) from A. thaliana, compare the features of these two clusters, and investigate the evolutionary events that have led to cluster formation.",
