  "question": "Is MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic effective for non-small-cell lung cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (MAGE-A3-positive non-small-cell lung cancer; MAGRIT), adjuvant treatment with the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic did not increase disease-free survival compared with placebo in patients with MAGE-A3-positive surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer. Based on these results, further development of the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic for use in non-small-cell lung cancer has been stopped.",

Of the patients who did not receive chemotherapy, median disease-free survival was 58\u00b70 months (95% CI 56\u00b76-not reached) in those in the MAGE-A3 group and 56\u00b79 months (44\u00b74-not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0\u00b797, 95% CI 0\u00b780-1\u00b718; p=0\u00b776). Because of the absence of treatment effect, we could not identify a gene signature predictive of clinical benefit to MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic. ",
