  "question": "Is there an association between borna virus and brain tumor?",
  "ideal_answer": "There is no data to suggest an association between borna virus and brain tumor. Borna disease virus establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system of vertebrate animal species as well as in tissue cultures causing cellular damage. Infected neural cells, include astrocytes, neurons, oligodendroglioma cell line. Borna disease virus replicates and can cause damage of brain cells.",
