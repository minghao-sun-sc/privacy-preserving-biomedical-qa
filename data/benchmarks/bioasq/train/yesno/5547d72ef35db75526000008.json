  "question": "Do all archaea possess multiple origins of DNA replication?",
  "ideal_answer": "Origins of DNA replication differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Though most archaea replicate their chromosomes using multiple origins, there are also certain archaea that possess a single origin of DNA replication (such as Pyrococcus abyssi and some archaea belonging in the hyperthermophilic order of Themococcales).",
