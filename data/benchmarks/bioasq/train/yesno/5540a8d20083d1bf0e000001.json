  "question": "Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Selective sweep is a phenomenon in which the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles within a population reduces genetic diversity at partially linked neutral loci. Reduced variation or deviations from neutrality, along with an excess of fixed replacement sites, are indicative of selective sweep.",
