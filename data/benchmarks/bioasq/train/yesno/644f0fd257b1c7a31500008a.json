  "question": "Do enhancers have to be close to their gene targets?",
  "ideal_answer": "Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements in the genome that cooperate with promoters to control target gene transcription. Unlike promoters, enhancers are not necessarily adjacent to target genes and can exert their functions regardless of enhancer orientations, positions, and spatial segregations from target genes.",
