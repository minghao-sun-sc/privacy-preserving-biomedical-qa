  "ideal_answer": "Yes, the rs34269950 SNP of the RUNX1T1 gene was significantly associated with obesity risk and metabolic abnormalities. Specifically, compared to AA genotype, rs34269950 del/del genotype was associated with a 1.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.14, P\u2009=\u20090.042] fold higher rate of obesity risk.",
