  "question": "Can desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, desvenlafaxine can be at 50mg/day to treat patients with major depressive disorder.  Studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg.",
