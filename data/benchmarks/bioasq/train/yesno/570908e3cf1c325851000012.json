  "question": "Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "EZH2 is an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer. EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells. EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells. Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.",
