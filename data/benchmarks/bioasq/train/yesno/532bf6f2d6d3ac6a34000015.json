  "question": "Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which is fundamental for neuronal development and specification. In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury",

Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, \u03b3-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, \u03b3-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes.",

Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, \u03b3-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that \u03b3-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure",

Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of \u03b3-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the \u03b3-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection",
