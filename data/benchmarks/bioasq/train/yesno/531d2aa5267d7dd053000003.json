  "question": "Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?",
  "ideal_answer": "BNP and NTproBNP increase early after exercise in healthy athletes performing different types of sports. It is unknown the reason of this increase. The transient increases in BNP, NT-pro-BNP and troponin T are more likely to reflect myocardial stunning than cardiomyocyte damage.",
