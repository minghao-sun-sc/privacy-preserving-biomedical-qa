Second, it is efficient for time series data to reveal periodic patterns. Here we present the R package spiralize that provides a general solution for visualizing data on spirals. spiralize implements numerous graphics functions so that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users. The flexibility and power of spiralize are demonstrated by five examples from real-world datasets.",
