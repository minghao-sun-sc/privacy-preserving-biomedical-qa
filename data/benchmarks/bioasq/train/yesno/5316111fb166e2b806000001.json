  "question": "Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. In different cell types, induction of forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 was found to increase expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase, and lead to suppression of oxidative stress.",
