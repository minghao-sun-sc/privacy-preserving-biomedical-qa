  "question": "Is there an association between FGFR3 mutation and plagiocephaly?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, FGFR3 mutation is associated with plagiocephaly. It is the most common mutation in plagiocephaly. FGFR genes have important effects on bone development, and mutations in 4 \"hot spot\" exons of FGFR1-3 are found in many patients with craniosynostosis and some with synostotic plagiocephaly.",
