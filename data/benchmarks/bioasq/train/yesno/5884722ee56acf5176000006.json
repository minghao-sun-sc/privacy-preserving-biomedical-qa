  "question": "Is Obeticholic Acid used for treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, obeticholic acid is a farnesoid-X receptor agonist that is approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid.",
