  "question": "Is SATB1 expressed in thymocytes?",
  "ideal_answer": "A thymocyte factor SATB1 suppresses transcription of stably integrated matrix-attachment region-linked reporter genes. SATB1 is a homeodomain protein and is predominantly expressed in thymocytes. In this study we show that special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), a T lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and regulator, is induced in response to TCR signaling during early thymocyte development",
