      "text": "Many researchers have recognized the positive effects of FTY720 and launched basic and clinical experiments to test the use of this agent against stroke. Although the mechanism of FTY720 has not been fully elucidated, its efficacy against cerebral stroke is becoming clear, not only in animal models, but also in ischemic stroke patients through clinical trials. In this article, we review the data obtained from laboratory findings and preliminary clinical trials using FTY720 for stroke treatment.",
