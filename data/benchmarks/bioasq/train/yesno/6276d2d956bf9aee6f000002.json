  "question": "Do angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation. Despite speculation that patients with COVID-19 who are receiving these agents may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, accumulating evidence does not support an association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with more severe disease. In addition, stopping these agents in some patients can exacerbate comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease and increase mortality.",
