  "question": "Is Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women associated with gestational diabetes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, there are multiple studies reporting an association between low VitD in pregnancy and impaired glucose tolerance, but it is not entirely clear if this translates directly to the increased risk of Gestational diabetes or via maternal obesity and/or genetic polymorphisms.",
