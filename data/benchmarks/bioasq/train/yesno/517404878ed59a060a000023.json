  "question": "Are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, some HDAC inhibitors, such as Vorinostat, are on trial for human treatment after proving successful in animal models. Combination with other drugs is likely to be needed to control metastasis.",
