  "question": "Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Several studies have estimated that gene fusion and fission are relatively rare events and the gene fusion/fission rate is approximately between 2 and 6. A conflicting case has been discovered in an analysis of plant genomes, where in Oryza sativa the opposite trend was observed.",

We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins.",
