  "question": "Is NicVAX vaccine effective for smoking cessation?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. NicVAX vaccine failed to meet the primary endpoint in two large phase III studies, although the correlation of higher abstinence rates in subjects with higher immunity to nicotine was observed. The nicotine vaccine, NicVAX, does not appear to improve the chances of stopping smoking when given in addition to varenicline and behavioural support.",
