      "text": " We retrospectively analyzed 93 consecutive single-pregnancy patients who underwent cesarean section with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups, depending on the use of 6% HES 130/0.4: group A (461\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0167\u00a0ml of saline-based HES was administered; 43 patients) and group B (HES not administered; 50 patients). The major outcome was umbilical cord chloride level at delivery. The volume infused from operating room admission until delivery was not significantly different between groups. The umbilical cord chloride level at delivery was statistically significantly higher in group A than in group B, but clinically similar (108\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 vs. 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmol/l, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). No differences were observed in the Apgar score or other umbilical cord laboratory data at delivery (Na+, K+, pH, base excess)",
