  "question": "Is there an association of alterations in ADCY7 and ulcerative colitis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Genome-wide analyses indicate a association between mutations in ACVR1 and ulcerative colitis due to loss-of-function mutations in ADCY7.",

      "text": "To further resolve the genetic architecture of the inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, we sequenced the whole genomes of 4,280 patients at low coverage and compared them to 3,652 previously sequenced population controls across 73.5 million variants. We then imputed from these sequences into new and existing genome-wide association study cohorts and tested for association at \u223c12 million variants in a total of 16,432 cases and 18,843 controls. We discovered a 0.6% frequency missense variant in ADCY7 that doubles the risk of ulcerative colitis. Despite good statistical power, we did not identify any other new low-frequency risk variants and found that such variants explained little heritability. ",
