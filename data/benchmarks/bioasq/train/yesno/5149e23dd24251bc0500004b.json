  "question": "Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, the use of marijuana is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke, especially in young adults. The mechanisms underlying such association remain largely unclear, but increased vascular reactivity and increased cerebrovascular resistance were implicated.",
