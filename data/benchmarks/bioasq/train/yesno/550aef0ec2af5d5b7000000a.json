  "question": "Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?",
  "ideal_answer": "CYLD is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling.  ",
