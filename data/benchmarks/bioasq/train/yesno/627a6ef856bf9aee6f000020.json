  "question": "Is lumbar puncture the first test that should be performed on a patient with increased intracranial pressure?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. A lumbar puncture is contraindicated in any patient with signs of increased intracranial pressure because it may precipitate cerebral herniation and death. For this reason, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is done first. When the findings of the scan are normal, a lumbar puncture can be performed, if needed.",
