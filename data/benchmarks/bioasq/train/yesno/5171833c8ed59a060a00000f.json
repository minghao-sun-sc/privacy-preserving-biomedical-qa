  "question": "Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Multiple lines of experimental evidence suggest that chromomethylases (CMTs) have been hitherto identified in plant genomes(Arabidopsis, maize, tomato). CMTs maintain CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and they are unique to the plant kingdom. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could be explained based on the fact that, in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. Therefore, the presence of CMTs is not required in the animal genomes.",
