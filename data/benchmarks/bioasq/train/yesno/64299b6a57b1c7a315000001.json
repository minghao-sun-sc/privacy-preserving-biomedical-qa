  "question": "Is COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant less severe than infection caused by other variants?",
  "ideal_answer": "Multiple contexts indicate that infection caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is less severe than infection caused by other variants. Studies have shown that Omicron is associated with milder symptoms and a lower risk of hospitalization compared to previous variants such as Delta. However, it is important to note that not all infected individuals experience a mild Omicron infection, and the severity of the illness can still vary depending on factors such as age and comorbidities.",
