  "question": "Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?",
  "ideal_answer": "Amantadine, a dopaminergic agent, has been shown to be effective for induction of recovery from disorders of consciousness. Amantadine is a commonly prescribed medication for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Amantadine accelerates the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. Higher dosing of amantadine may be considered in the setting of brain injury.",
