  "question": "Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, several compounds that inhibit different members of the proteasome pathway (for example Bortezomib) are on trial for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. It seems that a combination with other drugs may be a useful therapy for solid tumors.",
