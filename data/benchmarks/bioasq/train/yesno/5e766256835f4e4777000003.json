Following vaccine introduction (2007-2015), greater genotype diversity was observed with fluctuating genotype dominance. Genotype distribution varied based on the vaccine implemented, with G12P[8] dominant in states using RotaTeq, and equine-like G3P[8] and G2P[4] dominant in states and territories using Rotarix.",
