Common comorbidities encountered in patients with diabetes mellitus, such as renal insufficiency, high output states (iron deficiency anaemia, haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobinopathies and pregnancy) and intake of specific drugs could compromise the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker. COVID-19 pandemic poses a pressing challenge for the diabetic population, since maintaining optimal blood glucose control is key to reduce morbidity and mortality rates.",
