  "question": "Are transcription and splicing connected?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. There is strong evidence that splicing and transcription are intimately coupled in metazoans, with  genome wide surveys show that most splicing occurs during transcription. Chromatin structure, RNA polymerase dynamics, and recruitment of splicing factors through the transcriptional machinery are factors that explain a role for transcription in the regulation of splicing.",
