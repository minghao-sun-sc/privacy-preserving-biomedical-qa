Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease.
