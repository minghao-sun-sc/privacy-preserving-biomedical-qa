  "ideal_answer": "Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein with a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release.In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in HRC has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.",
