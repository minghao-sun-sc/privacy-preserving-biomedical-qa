  "question": "Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar and palmar surfaces.",
