  "question": "Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?",
  "ideal_answer": "No, although initial epidemiological studies on humans and on animal and cell- based models indicated that selenoproteins may be protecting against prostate cancer, more research is needed to improve the understanding of selenium metabolism and requirements for optimal health.",
