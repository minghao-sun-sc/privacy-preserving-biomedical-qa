  "question": "Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, it has been shown that it is possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound. Transcranial ultrasound is safe and reliable method that can be employed to monitor lead location and intraoperative visualization of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes.",

TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients. TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected.",
