  "question": "Are accessible enhancers necessarily active?",
  "ideal_answer": "DNA accessibility is thought to be of major importance in regulating gene expression. However, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of the accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states. While the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. In addition, another study has shown that euchromatin and heterochromatin can have very similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Together, these results show that many gene expression changes can happen independently of changes in the accessibility of local chromatin.",
