  "question": "Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) applied to medical research has revealed how germline variants and mutations may be associated with colorectal cancer. It is likely that this level of knowledge can be translated into predictions of predisposition.",

      "text": "Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%). In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients. The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites",
