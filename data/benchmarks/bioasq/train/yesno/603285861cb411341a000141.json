  "question": "Are Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induced by microbes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes,\nGram-negative bacteria and endogenous molecules coordinate to trigger inflammatory cascades via Toll-like receptor 4 to induce excessive expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and to activate NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that processes pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 into its mature form.",
