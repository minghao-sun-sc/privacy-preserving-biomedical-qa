  "question": "Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?",
  "ideal_answer": "Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection. Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters. Pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications and early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes.",
