  "question": "Is armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?",
  "ideal_answer": "No, armodafinil is not used for treatment of insomnia. Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in patients with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), shift work disorder (SWD), or narcolepsy. The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD.",

In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder.",
