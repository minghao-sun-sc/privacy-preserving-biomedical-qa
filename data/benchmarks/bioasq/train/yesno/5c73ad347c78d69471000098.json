Median survival follow-up (range) was 5.1 months (0.02-12.3) with axitinib/gemcitabine vs. 5.4 months (1.8-10.5) with placebo/gemcitabine. Similarly, no difference was detected in overall survival between axitinib/gemcitabine and placebo/gemcitabine in patients from North America or the European Union. ",
