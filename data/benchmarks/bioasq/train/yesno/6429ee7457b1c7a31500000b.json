  "question": "Can analgesics or antipyretics be taken for side effects following COVID-19 vaccination?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, short-term use of analgesics or antipyretics at non-prescription doses is unlikely to affect vaccine-induced immunity, according to available data from clinical trials of licensed COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations from public health bodies. However, prophylactic administration of antipyretic drugs at the time of vaccination is not recommended since antibody responses to several vaccine antigens may be reduced. Therapeutic treatment may be considered instead to ensure maximal vaccination efficacy and retain the possibility to treat pain and fever after vaccination.",

      "text": "Analgesics or antipyretic medications are often used to alleviate vaccine side effects, but their effect on immunogenicity remains uncertain. Few studies have assessed the effect of analgesics/antipyretics on vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Some studies revealed changes in certain immune response parameters post-vaccination when analgesics/antipyretics were used either prophylactically or therapeutically. Still, there is no evidence that these changes impact vaccine efficacy. Specific data on the impact of analgesic/antipyretic medications on immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines are limited. However, available data from clinical trials of licensed vaccines, along with recommendations from public health bodies around the world, should provide reassurance to both healthcare professionals and vaccine recipients that short-term use of analgesics/antipyretics at non-prescription doses is unlikely to affect vaccine-induced immunity.",

Only prophylactic paracetamol treatment, and not therapeutic treatment, during vaccination has a negative influence on the antibody concentration after hepatitis B vaccination in adults.
