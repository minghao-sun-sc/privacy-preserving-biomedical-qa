  "question": "Is there a phylogenetic analysis for HIV?",
  "ideal_answer": "In biology, phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms (e.g. species, populations), which are discovered through molecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices. The result of phylogenetic studies is a hypothesis about the evolutionary history of taxonomic groups: their phylogeny. \nPhylogenetic analysis examines small differences in HIV\u2019s genes using computational methods to calculate the genetic distance between strains. Unlike\nhuman DNA, which remains stable for a lifetime, HIV\u2019s RNA changes very rapidly, leading to a huge amount of genetic diversity. This diversity means that scientists, using phylogenetic analysis, have been able to ascertain where HIV comes from, as well as track the various strains of HIV that exist worldwide.\nBased on results, there are found many studies on HIV phylogenetic analysis.",
