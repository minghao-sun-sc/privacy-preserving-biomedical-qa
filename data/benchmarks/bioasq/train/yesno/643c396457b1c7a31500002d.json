  "question": "Are any medications available to prevent COVID-19 following exposure?",
  "ideal_answer": "Currently, no. Certain monoclonal antibodies had previously been demonstrated to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection after exposure, but they mostly lack activity against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nOther agents (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab) have not been shown to be effective.",
