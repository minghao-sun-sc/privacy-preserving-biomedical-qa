Nintedanib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks several profibrotic pathways, inhibiting proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and decreasing the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It is approved for idiopathic lung fibrosis and has demonstrated good results in inhibiting migration and proliferation of systemic sclerosis dermal fibroblasts, constituting a promising agent for systemic sclerosis-associated lung fibrosis.",
