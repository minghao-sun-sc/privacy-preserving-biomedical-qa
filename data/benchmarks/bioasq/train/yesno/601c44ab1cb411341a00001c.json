      "text": "BACKGROUND: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT/DNET) are rare epileptogenic tumors. Microsurgery remains the best treatment option, although case reports exist on the use of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in selected cases. We investigated the long-term outcome of GKRS-treated DNTs at our institution in the context of current diagnostic and treatment options.",

      "text": "Long-term seizure control was obtained after GKRS of two separate residual DNT components along the surgical margin (2005 and 2010). A 27-year-old male undergoing gross total resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of a DNT (1999) resulted in temporary control of intractable epilepsy despite AEDs; lasting clinical control of seizures was achieved in 2002 after GKRS of a small, recurrent DNT component. A 28-year-old male underwent STR of DNT (1994 and 2004) resulting in temporary control of intractable epilepsy. Lasting seizure control was gained after GKRS of a residual tumor (2005).CONCLUSION: GKRS as performed in our series was effective in terms of tumor and seizure control.",
