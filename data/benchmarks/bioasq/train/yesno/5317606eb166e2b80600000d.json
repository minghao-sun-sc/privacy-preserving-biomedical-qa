  "question": "Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, induction of alpha-tubulin acetylation correlates with inhibition of cell motility, while it is involved in additional cellular processes, e.g. cell cycle progression, differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and signalling. Dynamic microtubule (MT) acetylation/deacetylation mediating cell motility and adhesion is controlled by enzymes such as HDAC6, a major cytoplasmic \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase. While its overexpression and activation is capable to enhance cell motility, HDAC6 activity can also be negatively regulated by a number of cellular inhibitors, thus decreasing the ability of cells for migration.",

      "text": "In this study, we found that paclitaxel induced tubulin acetylation in endothelial and tumor cells, at concentrations that affected cell motility but not proliferation (10(-8) to 10(-9) M, for 4 hours). Induction of tubulin acetylation correlated with inhibition of motility but not proliferation based on a comparison of highly and poorly cytotoxic taxanes (paclitaxel and IDN5390) and tumor cell lines sensitive and resistant to paclitaxel (1A9 and 1A9 PTX22).",
