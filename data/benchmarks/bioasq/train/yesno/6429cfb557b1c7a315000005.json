  "question": "Should patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD be advised to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. There is no evidence to suggest that patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD should stop these medications to prevent COVID-19. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that these medications may have a protective role in preventing severe COVID-19.",
