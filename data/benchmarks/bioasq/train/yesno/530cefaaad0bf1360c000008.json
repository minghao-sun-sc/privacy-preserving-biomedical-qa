  "question": "Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?",
  "ideal_answer": "Lambrolizumab, a programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibody, has been shown to be effective for treatment of patients with melanoma. High rate of sustained tumor regression with mainly minimal adverse effects in melanoma patients treated with lambrolizumab has been reported. Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the year.",
