  "question": "Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is more common in women with endometriosis. It has been shown that 15% of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS. Women with endometriosis are more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS. Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as IBS.",
