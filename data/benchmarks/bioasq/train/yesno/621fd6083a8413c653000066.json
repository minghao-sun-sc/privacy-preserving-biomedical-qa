  "question": "Unlike DNA, RNA is not methylated, yes or no?",
  "ideal_answer": "In addition to DNA methylation, reversible epigenetic modification occurring in RNA has been discovered recently. The most abundant type of RNA methylation is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, which is dynamically regulated by methylases (\"writers\"), demethylases (\"erasers\") and m6A-binding proteins (\"readers\")",
