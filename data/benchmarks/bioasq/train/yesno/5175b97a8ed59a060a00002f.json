  "question": "Is alternative splicing of apoptotic genes playing a role in the response to DNA or mitochondrial damage?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, alternative splicing seem to play a key role in the response to DNA or mitocondrial damage as suggested by the number of apoptotic genes that are alternatively spliced, with often antagonistic roles of the isoforms generated.",
