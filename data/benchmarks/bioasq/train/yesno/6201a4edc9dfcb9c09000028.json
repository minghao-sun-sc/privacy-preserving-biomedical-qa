      "text": "GATA-12RA knock-in (KI) mice suffer mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with accumulation of immature erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of Lin- cKit+ (LK) cells further reveal a profound change in cell subpopulations and signature gene expression patterns in HSC, myeloid progenitors, and erythroid/megakaryocyte clusters in KI mice. Thus, GATA-1 deacetylation and its interaction with HDAC1 modulates GATA-1 chromatin binding and transcriptional activity that control erythroid/megakaryocyte commitment and differentiation.",
