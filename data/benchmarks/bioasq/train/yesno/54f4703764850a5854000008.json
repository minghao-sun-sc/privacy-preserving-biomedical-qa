  "question": "Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches",

Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21.
