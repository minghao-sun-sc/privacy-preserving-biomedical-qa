  "question": "Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, the heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome is well established. Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome than in the general population.",
