  "question": "Is ibudilast effective for multiple sclerosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, Ibudilast was shown to be effective for progressive multiple sclerosis. In a phase 2 trial involving patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, ibudilast was associated with slower progression of brain atrophy than placebo but was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects, headache, and depression.",
