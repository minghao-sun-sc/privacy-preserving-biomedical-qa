Tirabrutinib is also under regulatory review in Japan for the treatment of Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Clinical development is underway in the USA, Europe and Japan for autoimmune disorders, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B cell lymphoma, Sjogren's syndrome, pemphigus and rheumatoid arthritis. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of tirabrutinib leading to the first approval of tirabrutinib for the treatment of recurrent or refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma in Japan.",
