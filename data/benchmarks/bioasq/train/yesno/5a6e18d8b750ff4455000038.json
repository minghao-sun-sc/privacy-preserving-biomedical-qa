  "question": "Are Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) important in phylogenomics research?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes. Conserved Nonexonic Elements (CNEEs) appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.",
