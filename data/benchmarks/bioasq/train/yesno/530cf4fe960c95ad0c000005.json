  "question": "Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?",
  "ideal_answer": "No, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents. On the contrary, it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting. One study proposes that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in preclinical models",

In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.",
