  "question": "Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, selumetinib was shown to be effective treatment for thyroid cancer. Selumetinib may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Clinical efficacy of selumetinib was also investigated in other solid tumors.",
