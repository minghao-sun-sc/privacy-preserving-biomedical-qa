  "question": "Is methotrexate used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)?",
  "ideal_answer": "Yes, methotrexate is effective for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.  MTX can be administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or as mono-therapy. Response rate to MTX is more than 90%. MTX therapy is associated with improved survival of RA patients.",
