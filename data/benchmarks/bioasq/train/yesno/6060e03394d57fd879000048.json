  "question": "Are synonymous sites in primates and rodents functionally constrained?",
  "ideal_answer": "No. Synonymous sites in primates exhibited evidence for higher selective constraint that those in rodents. In primates up to 24% of synonymous sites could be under purifying selection, while in rodents synonymous sites evolved neutrally.",

      "text": "To resolve this contradiction between expectations and observations, we used processed pseudogenes as a model for strict neutral evolution, and estimated selective constraint on synonymous sites using the rate of substitution at pseudosynonymous and pseudononsynonymous sites in pseudogenes as the neutral expectation. After controlling for the effects of GC content, our results were similar to those from previous studies, i.e., synonymous sites in primates exhibited evidence for higher selective constraint that those in rodents. Specifically, our results indicated that in primates up to 24% of synonymous sites could be under purifying selection, while in rodents synonymous sites evolved neutrally. ",
