  "question": "Which mRNAs are sequestered in stress granules?",
  "ideal_answer": "Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins that form when translation initiation is inhibited. \nThis subset of mRNAs is characterized by extended length and adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for cell survival and proliferation. mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability",
