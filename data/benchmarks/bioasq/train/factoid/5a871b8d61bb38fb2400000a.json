Here, we have used two-photon Ca2+imaging to monitor the\u00a0activity of mossy cells in awake, behaving mice. We find that mossy cells are significantly more active than dentate granule cells in\u00a0vivo, exhibit spatial tuning during head-fixed spatial navigation, and undergo robust remapping of their spatial representations in response to contextual manipulation. Our\u00a0results provide a functional characterization of mossy cells in the behaving animal and demonstrate their active participation in spatial coding and contextual representation.",
