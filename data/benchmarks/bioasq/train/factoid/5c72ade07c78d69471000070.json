Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment.",
