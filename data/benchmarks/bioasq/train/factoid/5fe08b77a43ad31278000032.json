  "ideal_answer": "Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed prenatally . It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene . Of the 37 patients with classic features of the syndrome, the overall detection rate for TWIST mutations was 68% . Increased risk for developmental delay is associated with TWIST deletions .",
