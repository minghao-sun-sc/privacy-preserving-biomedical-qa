  "question": "Which residue of alpha-synuclein was found to be phosphorylated in Lewy bodies?",
  "ideal_answer": "Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (S129) is highly elevated in Parkinson's disease patients where it mainly accumulates in the Lewy bodiesApproximately 90% of \u03b1-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% or less of total \u03b1-syn is phosphorylated at this residue in the normal brain. This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease",
