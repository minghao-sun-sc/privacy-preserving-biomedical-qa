  "question": "What regulatory element promotes RNA polymerase II binding as well as the binding of factors that facilitate the unwinding of DNA prior to translation?",
  "ideal_answer": "Found in about 24% of human gene promoters, the TATA box is a critical regulatory element that is mostly found in genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and as such, recruits this enzyme to the promoter. Additionally, the TATA-binding protein aids in unwinding DNA.",
