  "ideal_answer": "The coronavirus peplomer protein S is responsible for attachment and fusion during viral entry as well as for the induction of cell to cell fusion.\nSince tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity,",
