  "question": "Which transcription factor is considered as a master regulator of lysosomal genes?",
  "ideal_answer": "Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, driving lysosome adaptation to environmental cues, such as starvation, and therefore targeting of TFEB may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating lysosomal function in human disease.",
