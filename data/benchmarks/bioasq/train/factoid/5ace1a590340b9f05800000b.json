  "question": "What percentage of Homo sapiens DNA is of Neanderthal origin?",
  "ideal_answer": "We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe.",
