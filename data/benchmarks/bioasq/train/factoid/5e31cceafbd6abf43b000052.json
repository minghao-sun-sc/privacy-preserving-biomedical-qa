  "question": "What is the chromosomal location of the LDL receptor gene associated with autosomal dominant Familial Hypercholesterolemia?",
  "ideal_answer": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited metabolic disorder resulting in advanced vascular atherosclerosis and premature death, primarily from coronary artery disease. The primary defect is a mutation in the gene encoding for the plasma LDL receptor located on the short arm of chromosome 19",
