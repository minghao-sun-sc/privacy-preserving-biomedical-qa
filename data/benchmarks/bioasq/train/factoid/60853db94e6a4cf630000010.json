      "text": "Recent technological advances in RNA sequencing and analysis have allowed an increasingly thorough investigation of a previously unexplored class of transcripts, circular (circ)RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that circRNAs have unique functions which often rely on their association with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Through these interactions, circRNAs have been implicated in major cellular processes and hence in the pathophysiology of a range of diseases. ",
