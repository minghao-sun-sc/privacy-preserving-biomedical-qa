  "question": "Which component of the Influenza A Virus affects mRNA transcription termination?",
  "ideal_answer": "Defective Pol II termination occurs independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs).",
