  "question": "Which is the most prevalent form of arrhythmia worldwide?",
  "ideal_answer": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, and it has a significant effect on morbidity and mortality. It is a significant risk factor for stroke and peripheral embolization, and it has an effect on cardiac function. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting up to 1-1.5% of the population.",
