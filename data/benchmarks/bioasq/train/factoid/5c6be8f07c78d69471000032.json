  "question": "Which database has been developed that contains experimentally-confirmed carbonylated proteins?",
  "ideal_answer": "Protein carbonylation, a chemically diverse oxidative post-translational modification, is widely considered as the biomarker for oxidative stress and protein damage. CarbonylDB has been developed as a manually curated data-resource of experimentally-confirmed carbonylated proteins/sites. The CarbonylDB currently contains 1495 carbonylated proteins and 3781 sites from 21 species, with human, rat and yeast as the top three species.",

Despite their importance and extensive studies, no database/resource on carbonylated proteins/sites exists. As such information is very useful to research in biology/medicine, we have manually curated a data-resource (CarbonylDB) of experimentally-confirmed carbonylated proteins/sites.Results: The CarbonylDB currently contains 1495 carbonylated proteins and 3781 sites from 21 species, with human, rat and yeast as the top three species. We have made further analyses of these carbonylated proteins/sites and presented their occurrence and occupancy patterns. Carbonylation site data on serum albumin, in particular, provides a fine model system to understand the dynamics of oxidative protein modifications/damage.",
