  "question": "What is the association of spermidine with \u03b1-synuclein neurotoxicity?",
  "ideal_answer": "Spermidine protects against \u03b1-synuclein neurotoxicity. In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human \u03b1-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this line, administration of spermidine rescued \u03b1-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.",

      "text": "Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology. In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human \u03b1-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.
