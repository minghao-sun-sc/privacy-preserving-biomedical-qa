      "text": "Finally, administration of a single dose of rHDL-apoE3 in apoE KO mice markedly improved vascular permeability as demonstrated by the reduced concentration of Evans Blue dye in tissues such as the stomach, the tongue and the urinary bladder and ameliorated hypercholesterolemia.CONCLUSIONS: rHDL-apoE3 significantly enhanced EC migration in vitro, predominantly via overexpression of ID1 and subsequent activation of MEK1/2 and PI3K, and their downstream targets ERK1/2, AKT and p38 MAPK, respectively and improved vascular permeability in vivo.
