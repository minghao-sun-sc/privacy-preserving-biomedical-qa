Moreover, being related to stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the \"pufferfishes\" Takifugu and Tetraodon, and even more closely related to medaka (Oryzias latipes), it can greatly beneficiate from the recent development of genomic resources for these fish models and in the future become a complete model system for the aging research community.",
