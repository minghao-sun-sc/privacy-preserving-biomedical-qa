  "question": "In which kingdom do microsporidia belong, according to their current classification scheme?",
  "ideal_answer": "Traditionally, microsporidia were considered as protozoans, but recently they have been reclassified as the earliest-diverging clade of sequenced fungi. Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites; they are ubiquitous fungi, with genomes that have undergone a strong reduction.",
