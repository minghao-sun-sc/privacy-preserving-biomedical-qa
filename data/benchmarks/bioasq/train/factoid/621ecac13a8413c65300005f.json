Recently, new primaquine-based hybrids as new molecules with potential multi-acting anti-malarial activity were reported and two hybrids of primaquine linked to quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide (PQ-QdNO) were identified as the most active against erythrocytic, exoerythrocytic and sporogonic stages.METHODS: To further understand the anti-malarial mode of action (MA) of these hybrids, hepg2-CD81 were infected with Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL and treated with PQ-QdNO hybrids during 48\u00a0h. After were evaluated the production of ROS, the mitochondrial depolarization, the total glutathione content, the DNA damage and proteins related to oxidative stress and death cell.RESULTS: In a preliminary analysis as tissue schizonticidals, these hybrids showed a mode of action dependent on peroxides production, but independent of the activation of transcription factor p53, mitochondrial depolarization and arrest cell cycle.CONCLUSIONS: Primaquine-quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide hybrids exert their antiplasmodial activity in the exoerythrocytic phase by generating high levels of oxidative stress which promotes the increase of total glutathione levels, th",
