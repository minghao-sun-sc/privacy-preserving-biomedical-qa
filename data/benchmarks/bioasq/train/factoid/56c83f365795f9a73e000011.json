      "text": "Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules. Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules.",

PrLDs are over-represented in human RNA-binding proteins and mediate phase transitions underpinning RNP granule assembly. This modality renders PrLDs prone to misfold into conformers that accrue in pathological inclusions that characterize various fatal neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS.",
