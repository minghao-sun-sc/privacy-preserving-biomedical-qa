  "question": "What is the incubation period for COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "For COVID-19, the mean incubation period was 6.0\u00a0days globally but near 7.0\u00a0days in the mainland of China, which will help identify the time of infection and make disease control decisions. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain.",
