  "question": "Which histone mark distinguishes active from inactive enhancers?",
  "ideal_answer": "Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state . In contrast, elements of the second class 'poised enhancers' are linked to genes inactive in hESCs . They are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation .",
