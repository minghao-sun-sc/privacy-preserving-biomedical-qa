  "question": "Which gene is responsible for the development of Sotos syndrome?",
  "ideal_answer": "Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts for a majority of patients with SoS.",
