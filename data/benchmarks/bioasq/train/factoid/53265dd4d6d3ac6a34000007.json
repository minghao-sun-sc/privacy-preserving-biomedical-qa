  "question": "What is the prognostic role of alterred thyroid profile after cardiosurgery?",
  "ideal_answer": "Altered thyroid profile after cardiosurgery is associated with high incidence of atrial fibrillation e delay in recovery (prolonged hospitalisation) in adults and higher score on The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM; P < 0.042) and a longer duration of ventilation in children.Impportantly in transplanted patients altered thyroid metabolism,low T3 syndrome, is characterized by highest mortality, highest incidence of acute rejection or reoperations and infections",
