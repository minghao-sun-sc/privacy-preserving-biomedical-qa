  "question": "What is the lay name of the treatment for CCSVI (chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency)  in multiple sclerosis.",
  "ideal_answer": "The so-called \"LIberation therapy\" is in fact Endovascular Treatment and consists of PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty), which is dilatation of the internal jugular and/or azygous veins by a catheter venography. Stent placement is optional but has been strongly advised against as being dangerous.",
