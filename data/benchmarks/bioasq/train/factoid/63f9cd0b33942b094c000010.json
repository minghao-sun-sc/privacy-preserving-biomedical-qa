      "text": "RNA interference-mediated knockdown experiments identified two splicing factors, RBFOX2 and PTBP1, as regulators of microexon splicing in CRC cells. RBFOX2 and PTBP1 were found to directly bind to microexon-containing pre-mRNAs and to control their splicing in such cells. Differential microexon splicing was shown to be due, at least in part, to altered expression of RBFOX2 and PTBP1 in CRC tissue compared to matched normal tissue. ",
