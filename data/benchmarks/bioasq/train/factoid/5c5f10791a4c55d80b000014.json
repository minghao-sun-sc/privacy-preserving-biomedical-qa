  "question": "What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?",
  "ideal_answer": "Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted post-translational regulation. PolyA polymerase (PAP) adds a polyA tail onto the 3'-end of RNAs without a nucleic acid template, using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a substrate.",
