      "text": "Drug delivery to the suprachoroidal space (SCS\u00ae) has become a clinical reality after the 2021 FDA approval of CLS-TA, a triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension for suprachoroidal use (XIPERE\u00ae), administered via a microneedle-based device, the SCS Microinjector\u00ae. Suprachoroidal (SC) delivery facilitates targeting, compartmentalization, and durability of small molecule suspensions, thereby potentially addressing some of the efficacy, safety, and treatment burden limitations of current retinal therapies.
