  "question": "Should acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) be used when providing supportive care for COVID-19?",
  "ideal_answer": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been theorized to cause harm in patients with COVID-19, but clinical data are limited. Given the uncertainty, acetaminophen is the preferred antipyretic agent for most patients rather than NSAIDs. If NSAIDs are needed, the lowest effective dose is recommended.",

      "text": "Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.",
