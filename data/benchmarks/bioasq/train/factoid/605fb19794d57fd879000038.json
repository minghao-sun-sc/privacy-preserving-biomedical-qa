  "question": "Which resource is used for visualisation of non-covalent contacts?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Protein Contacts Atlas is an interactive resource of non-covalent contacts from over 100,000 PDB crystal structures. The Protein Contacts Atlas enables researchers from different disciplines to investigate diverse questions in the framework of non-covalent contacts, including the interpretation of allostery, disease mutations and polymorphisms, by exploring individual subunits, interfaces, and protein-ligand contacts and by mapping external information. The Protein Contacts Atlas is available at http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/pca/ and also through PDBe.",

      "text": "We present the Protein Contacts Atlas, an interactive resource of non-covalent contacts from over 100,000 PDB crystal structures. We developed multiple representations for visualization and analysis of non-covalent contacts at different scales of organization: atoms, residues, secondary structure, subunits, and entire complexes. The Protein Contacts Atlas enables researchers from different disciplines to investigate diverse questions in the framework of non-covalent contacts, including the interpretation of allostery, disease mutations and polymorphisms, by exploring individual subunits, interfaces, and protein-ligand contacts and by mapping external information.
