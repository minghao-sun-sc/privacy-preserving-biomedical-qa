  "question": "What is the role of gamma-secreatase complex in Alzheimer's Disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, as it cleaves a precursor protein to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients. Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer.",
