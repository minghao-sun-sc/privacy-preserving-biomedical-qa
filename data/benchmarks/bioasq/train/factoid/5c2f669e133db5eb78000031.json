  "question": "How many genes in S. cerevisiae are the result of an ancient whole genome duplication?",
  "ideal_answer": "The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently.",
