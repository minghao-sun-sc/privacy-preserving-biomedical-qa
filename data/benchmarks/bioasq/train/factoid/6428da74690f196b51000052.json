  "question": "What is the process that generates multiple transcripts from the same gene?",
  "ideal_answer": "The process that generates multiple transcripts from the same gene is called alternative splicing (AS). AS is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that allows for the production of different mRNA isoforms from a single gene. This process can increase proteome diversity and regulate mRNA levels, which is important for expanding proteomic complexity and functional diversity in higher eukaryotes. In plants, AS may also serve as a buffer against stress-responsive transcriptomes to reduce the metabolic cost of translating all AS transcripts. While the contribution of AS to proteome complexity remains elusive in plants, it is clear that this process plays an important role in regulating gene expression and generating protein isoforms with distinct functions.",
