  "question": "Which virus can be diagnosed with the monospot test?",
  "ideal_answer": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be detected with the monospot test. EBV is a highly prevalent virus, transmitted via saliva, which often causes asymptomatic infection in children but frequently results in infectious mononucleosis in adolescents.",

He was taken to theatre for urgent splenectomy. The unifying diagnosis was infectious mononucleosis complicated by spontaneous splenic rupture secondary to Epstein-Barr virus infection.",

The determinants of whether the infection causes IM remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate seasonality and temporal trends in IM.METHODS: Data from all Monospot tests, used as a marker for IM, were collected from the Grampian population over 16 years.RESULTS: Positive Monospot test results peaked at 17 years in females and 19 in males.
