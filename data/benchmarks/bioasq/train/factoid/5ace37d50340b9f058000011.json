  "question": "Which is the main reason for the increase in the incidence of cryptococcal disease?",
  "ideal_answer": "It is an increasing cause of infection in immunosuppressed patients, most notably those with HIV infection. Currently, 4.0% patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom are known to have developed cryptococcosis. The incidence of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans has increased four-fold in the last decade. ",
