  "question": "How many pseudogenes are contained in the C. elegans genome?",
  "ideal_answer": "Evidence suggests that a fifth of annotated Caenorhabditis elegans genes may be pseudogenes.  At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Thus out of 18000 transcripts, around 3500 are expected to be pseudogenes.",
