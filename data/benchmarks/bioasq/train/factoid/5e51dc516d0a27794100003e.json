      "text": "The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort.METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor \u03baB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex\u00a0vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses.",
