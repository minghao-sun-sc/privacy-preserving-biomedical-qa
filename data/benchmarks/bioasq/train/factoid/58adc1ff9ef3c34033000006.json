  "question": "Which protein mediates gene loop formation in the yeast S. cerevisiae?",
  "ideal_answer": "Moreover, looping is dependent upon the general transcription factor TFIIB: the E62K (glutamic acid 62 --> lysine) form of TFIIB adversely affects looping at every gene tested, including BLM10, SAC3, GAL10, SEN1, and HEM3. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP.",
