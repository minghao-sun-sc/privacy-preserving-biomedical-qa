Study patients suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections, COPD or were mechanically ventilated in intensive care units. In the first 2 populations, use of antibiotics was associated with an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but in intensive care patients the opposite was documented",
