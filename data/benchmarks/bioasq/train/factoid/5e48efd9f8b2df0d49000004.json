  "question": "What is the aim of the \"Radiogenomics Consortium\"?",
  "ideal_answer": "A major aim of research in radiogenomics is the development of a predictive instrument to enable identification of people who are at greatest risk for adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment using radiation. An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics.",

Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. ",
