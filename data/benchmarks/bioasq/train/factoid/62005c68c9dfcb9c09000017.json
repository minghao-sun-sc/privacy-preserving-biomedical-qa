  "ideal_answer": "GprotPRED is an online tool that uses profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) and application to proteomes. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the G\u03b2 case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%.",

      "text": "An online tool, GprotPRED, was developed that uses these six pHMMs. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the G\u03b2 case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%. In contrast to Pfam's pHMM which detects G\u03b1 subunits in general, our method not only detects G\u03b1 subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate G\u03b1-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes. GprotPRED online tool is publicly available for non-commercial use at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/GprotPRED and, also, a standalone version of the tool at https://github.com/vkostiou/GprotPRED.",
