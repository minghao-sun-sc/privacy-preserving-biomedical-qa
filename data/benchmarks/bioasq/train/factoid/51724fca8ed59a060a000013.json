      "text": "If we use N, M and C to represent the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function of N and M when C = O(log(N + M)). When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm.",
