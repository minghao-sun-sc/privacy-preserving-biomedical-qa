  "question": "Which translocation is harbored in the Askin tumor cells?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Askin tumor is a primitive malignant small-cell tumor of the chest wall mostly seen among children and adolescents. It is closely related to Ewing's sarcoma of the same location, with both tumors harboring reciprocal translocation t(11;22) (q24;q12).",
