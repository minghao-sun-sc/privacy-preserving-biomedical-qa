  "ideal_answer": "The interaction of two water-soluble furocoumarins, 8-(omega-diethyl aminopropyloxy)psoralen hydrochloride (I) and its 5-isomer (II), with DNA has been investigated by spectroscopic, equilibrium dialysis, hydrodynamic and chiroptical techniques. Both compounds intercalate into the polynucleotide double helix.",
