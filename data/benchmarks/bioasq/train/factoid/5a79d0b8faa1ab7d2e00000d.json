      "text": "This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase \u03b5 (Pol \u03b5) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases \u03b1 and \u03b4 carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively. ",
