A combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, shows 131 genes with increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA.",
