  "question": "In prokaryotes, functionally related genes are sometimes positioned adjacent to each other in the genome and can be under the control of the same regulatory machinery. What are these called?",
  "ideal_answer": "In prokaryotes, functionally related genes are often organized into operons. Operons are clusters of adjacent genes that are transcribed together under the control of a single promoter, allowing for coordinated gene expression and efficient co-translation of proteins involved in the same cellular pathway. This organization is a fundamental element of how genetic information is arranged in prokaryotes and ensures that coregulated gene expression occurs through co-transcription. The arrangement of functionally-related genes in operons provides spatiotemporal control over cellular processes, contributing to the overall regulation and efficiency of prokaryotic gene expression.",
