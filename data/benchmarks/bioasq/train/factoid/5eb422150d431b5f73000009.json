  "question": "Which was the first species in which a de novo gene emergence (\"gene birth\") was reported?",
  "ideal_answer": "New genes can arise through duplication of a pre-existing gene or de novo from non-coding DNA, providing raw material for evolution of new functions in response to a changing environment. A prime example is the independent evolution of antifreeze glycoprotein genes (afgps) in the Arctic codfishes and Antarctic notothenioids to prevent freezing.",
