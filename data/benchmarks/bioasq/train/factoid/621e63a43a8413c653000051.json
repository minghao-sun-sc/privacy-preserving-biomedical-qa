This approach exploits state-of-the-art machine learning for concept identification by utilising an expert annotated rare disease corpus from the PMC Text Mining subset. Evaluation of the system for entities is conducted on a gold-standard corpus of rare disease sentences and for associations against the Monarch initiative data.",
