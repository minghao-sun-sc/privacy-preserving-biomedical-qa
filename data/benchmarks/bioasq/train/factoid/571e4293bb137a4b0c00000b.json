  "question": "What is the cause of episodic ataxia type 6?",
  "ideal_answer": "Episodic ataxia type 6, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a glial glutamate transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter-1. Reduced glutamate uptake by mutant excitatory amino acid transporter-1 (EAAT1) has been thought to be the main pathophysiological process in episodic ataxia type 6.",
