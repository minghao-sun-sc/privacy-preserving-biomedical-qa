  "question": "In which phase of cell cycle does  stress-induced transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) occur?",
  "ideal_answer": "Factors involved in RNA polymerase (RNAP) processivity or transcriptional derepression, such as Mfd (transcription coupling repair factor), contribute to the generation of stress-induced mutations. Under stress, transcription-associated mutagenesis is increased. Stress-induced transcription-associated mutations are acquired by nondividing cells, during stationary phase, and are not observed under conditions of exponential growth.",

In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling repair factor",
