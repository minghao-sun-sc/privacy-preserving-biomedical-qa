  "question": "Which syndrome is caused by pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants?",
  "ideal_answer": "Massively parallel sequencing identifies pathogenic variants in the genes affected in Alport syndrome (COL4A3-COL4A5) in as many as 30% of individuals with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 10% of those with kidney failure of unknown cause, and 20% with familial immunoglobulin A (IgA) glomerulonephritis. The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants, but must be adjusted for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions.",
