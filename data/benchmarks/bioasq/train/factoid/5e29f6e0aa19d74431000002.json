We investigated effects associated with LB100 treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100 had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines. It also attenuated MB cell migration, a pre-requirement for invasion. ",
