  "question": "Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?",
  "ideal_answer": "Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. In almost 95% of the cases, it is driven by oncogenic fusion protein EWS/FLI1, which acts as an aberrant transcription factor, that upregulates or downregulates target genes, leading to cellular transformation.",
