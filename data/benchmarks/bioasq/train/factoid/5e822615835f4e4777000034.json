  "question": "Which protein is mutated in Erythropoietic Protoporphyria?",
  "ideal_answer": "Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare inherited disorder of the heme biosynthesis pathway resulting in the accumulation of protoporphyrins in the blood, erythrocytes, and other tissues. Because of a gene mutation in the FECH gene, ferrochelatase, the enzyme involved in the final step of heme synthesis, is deficient in these patients.",
