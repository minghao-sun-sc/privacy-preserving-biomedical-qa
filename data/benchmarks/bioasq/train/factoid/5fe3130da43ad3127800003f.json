  "question": "What does \"28\" stand for in the Disease Activity Score DAS28?",
  "ideal_answer": "It stands for the Disease Activity Score 28 Joint Index (DAS28). It\u2019s basically a measure of how active a patient is in regards to how active they are in relation to the DAS28. The 28 joint DAS (28 joints) is a way to measure how active the patient is compared to other people with the same disease.",
