  "ideal_answer": "A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor or7d4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene  p = 1.1 \u00d7 10  -4.Any mammals can decipher these scent codes to discern the gender , age , endocrine status , social status , and genotype of conspecifics using dedicated sensory receptors in their olfactory system.",
