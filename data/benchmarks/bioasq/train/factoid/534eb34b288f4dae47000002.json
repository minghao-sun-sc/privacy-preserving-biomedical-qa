  "question": "In which process Src, Cortactin and MT1-MMP are playing an essential role?",
  "ideal_answer": "Src was shown to be required for invadopodia formation and function, whereas Cortactin was found to regulate cofilin and N-WASp activities to control the stages of invadopodium assembly and maturation. Finally, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) was demostrated as the key invadopodial enzyme responsible for gelatin matrix degradation in cancer cells.",
