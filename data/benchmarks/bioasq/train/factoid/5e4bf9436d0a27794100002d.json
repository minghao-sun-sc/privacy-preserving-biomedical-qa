  "question": "Which transcription factor controls Drosophila's Hes genes?",
  "ideal_answer": "The Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes . In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which shut off achaete-scute transcription . The molecular details of how Hes and Hey proteins control transcription are still poorly understood .",
