  "question": "What is the main symptom of Marfan syndrome patients?",
  "ideal_answer": "The diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome remain controversial. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes. The risk of aortic dissection, which is the most serious manifestation of the Marfan syndrome, increases as the aorta enlarges. Surgical replacement of the aortic root with a composite graft does not end the disease process.",
