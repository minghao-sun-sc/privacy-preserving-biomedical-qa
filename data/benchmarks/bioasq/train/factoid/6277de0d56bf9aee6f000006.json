  "question": "What is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?",
  "ideal_answer": "MRI is the most sensitive tool for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). It can detect asymptomatic lesions in the white matter and is the most predictive test for diagnosing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). It is also a reliable measure of the current disease activity. The presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis of MS.",
