Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model.",

All of them share homologous catalytic domains. DNMT1 is the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdmaintenance\u201d methyltransferase family. DNMT1 is specific for hemi-methylated DNA and ensures the faithful transmission of DNA methylation patterns in every replication cycle. DNMT3 is required for de novo methylation of DNA. DNMT3 targets unmethylated DNA and is responsible for the establishment of new methylation patterns. Dnmt2, in contrast to all other mammalian DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, does not possess a large N-terminal regulatory domain. The DNA methylation activity of DNMT2 is still controversial.",

The Xist RNA has two major splicing variants: long and short isoforms. It is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and required for the silencing of most genes on that chromosome. The specific localization of Xist transcripts to the inactive X is important for silencing, but it is not known how these transcripts localize to the inactive X chromosome. Silencing on the inactive X chromosome coincides with the acquisition of chromatin modifications, resulting in the formation of extraordinarily stable facultative heterochromatin that is faithfully propagated through subsequent cell divisions. The integration of all these processes requires a region of the X chromosome known as the X-inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene and its cis-regulatory elements.",

The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.",

Two days after her discharge from the hospital, she began experiencing pain and swelling of the right leg. Doppler ultrasound imaging at this time revealed a deep venous thrombosis in the right popliteal and tibial veins. The patient was re-admitted and started on an unfractionated heparin infusion. Five days later, doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities revealed extension of the clot in the right lower extremity to include the common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, tibial, and saphenous veins. In addition, a thrombus was noted in the left common femoral vein as well. CBC showed a decrease in platelet count from 195,000/uL on admission to 83,000/uL.

    "exact_answer": "",
    "ideal_answer": "Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT). Based on similarity of electrocardiographic features, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia has been considered a variant of long QT syndrome. Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively. This \"ping pong\" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy.",

There are five categories of genes associated with puQTLs, distinguishing single from multi-promoter genes. Among multi-promoter genes, puQTL effects are either specific to a single promoter or to multiple promoters with variable effect orientations.

    "answer": "The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography.

A hard nodule was felt on a digital rectal exam, which led to a prostate biopsy that revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma. A bone scan at that time showed small, focal abnormalities in the lumbar spine. He subsequently underwent radiation therapy to his prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. He was then placed on leuprolide and an anti-androgen. He was doing well until 2 months ago when he developed low back pain, which has worsened since then. He reports that the pain is 8/10 and nearly constant. He states that the pain not only affects his ability to fall asleep but also wakes him up at night. The pain is mildly alleviated by ibuprofen. In addition to prostate cancer, his medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and pantoprazole. Upon physical examination, there is midline tenderness within the lumbar region. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine is obtained, which shows bony metastasis to the L2 and L3 spine without evidence of fracture or spinal cord compression.
